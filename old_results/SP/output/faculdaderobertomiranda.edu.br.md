Some of our latest students opinions about the Silicon Valley Bootcamp® experience
###### Rafael Rezende Zambrana   
Silicon Valley Bootcamp® participant
###### Rafael Saul Franco  
Silicon Valley Bootcamp® participant
The trip was wonderful, it exceeded all my expectations, and it was one of the best trips of my life. I learnt about many relevant areas of the world in the time we live in, and it gave me opportunities that i never thought i would have. The parties and the bus trips were happy and joyful, good music that everybody knew, it was endless singing. I've made friendships that i pretend to take to life.
grade 11 out of 10!
I loved the Bootcamp. I found it very complete, going through different content. The teachers were amazing, everyone for sure added a lot. The people i met were incredible. I Believe that the Bootcamp fulfilled its mission of making my mindset more entrepreneurial! 
In the bootcamp it was possible to learn about new teaching methodologies that should work as inspiration for new paths and changes in Colégio Pentagono, particularly on the subject of entrepreneurship.
