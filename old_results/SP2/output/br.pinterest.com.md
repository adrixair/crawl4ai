my rate: 9/10 easily became a comfort show. it has a good balance between romance and comedy and i absolutely adore the female lead’s character. the only thing that bothered me was how bland jooda and namjoo’s relationship was. idk it just kinda threw me off at some points. orher than that, the cast has such good chemistry and i would definitely watch it again.

Terms of Service
# Thank you for using Pinterest!
These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of any website, app, service, technology, API, widget, platform, channel or any other products or features owned, operated, branded or offered by Pinterest (“Pinterest” or the “Service”), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply. For the purposes of these Terms, “we” or “us” refers to the party with whom you are entering into this agreement, per Section 13(e) (Parties). Please read these Terms carefully, and contact us if you have any questions.
You may not use the Service to do or share anything that is contrary to these Terms. For clarity, these Terms include, and incorporate by reference, the following policies:
  * Our Community Guidelines, which explain what is and isn’t allowed on Pinterest;
  * Our Advertising Guidelines and Merchant Guidelines, which explain additional policies that apply to ads and merchants on Pinterest; 
  * Our Commercial and Branded Content Guidelines, which explain additional policies that apply to sponsored, branded or otherwise commercial content; and
  * Our Enforcement practices, which explain how we put our policies into practice, including restrictions we may impose on your content on or use of Pinterest.


By accessing or using Pinterest, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms and you will not attempt to circumvent them. If you do not agree to our Terms, you must not access or use Pinterest.
More simply put
Every company has its terms. These are ours. They include these Terms of Service and other policies listed above.
# 1. The Service
Pinterest helps to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. To do that, we show you things we think will be relevant, interesting and personal to you based on your onsite and offsite activity. To provide the Service, we need to be able to identify you and your interests, and we use your personal data to do this. For more information, please read our Privacy Policy. Some of the things we show you are promoted by advertisers. As part of the Service we try to ensure that even promoted content is relevant and interesting to you. You can identify promoted content because it will be clearly labeled.
More simply put
Pinterest helps to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. We'll use your interests to show you content and ads on and off Pinterest that are relevant to you.
# 2. Using Pinterest
### a. Who can use Pinterest
You may use Pinterest only if you follow these Terms and all applicable laws. Using Pinterest may include downloading software to your computer, phone, tablet or other device. You agree that we may automatically update that software, and these Terms will apply to any updates. When you create your Pinterest account, you must provide us with accurate and complete information.
Any use or access to Pinterest by anyone under the age of 13 is not allowed. If you are older than 13, you can use Pinterest if you are over the minimum age of consent in your country. If you are 13 to 18, you may only use the Service with the permission of your parent or legal guardian. Please be sure your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms with you.
If we’ve previously disabled your account for violating these Terms, any of our policies or for legal reasons, you will not create a new Pinterest account without our express written permission, which is provided at our sole discretion.
In using Pinterest, you agree not to scrape, collect, search, copy or otherwise access data or content from Pinterest in unauthorized ways, such as by using automated means (without our express prior permission), or access or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.
You may not use, access, download, or otherwise make available the Service (including related software), except as authorized by applicable trade restrictions, including but not limited to US, EU and UK sanctions and export controls. You agree not to use the Service for any purpose prohibited by applicable trade restrictions.
Any use of Pinterest not expressly permitted by these Terms is a breach of these Terms and may violate copyright, trademark, and other laws.
### b. Our license to you
Subject to your compliance with these Terms and our policies, we hereby grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable license to access and use the Service as contemplated under these Terms and our policies.
You may not permit Pinterest to be used by or for the benefit of unauthorized third parties. Nothing in these Terms will be construed to grant you any right to transfer or assign rights to access or use Pinterest. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by us and our licensors. Except as described in Section 3(b), you may not: (i) modify or make derivative works based upon the Service; (ii) reverse engineer the Service; or (iii) copy any features or functions of the Service.
### c. Commercial use of Pinterest
If you want to use Pinterest for commercial purposes, you must create a business account and agree to our Business Terms of Service. If you do open an account for a company, organization or other entity, then "you" includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in these Terms and bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity's behalf. To the extent that any provisions in the Business Terms of Service conflict with these Terms, the Business Terms of Service shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
If you post content on Pinterest that is sponsored or branded – like when a business partner pays or incentivizes you to post it – or is in any way commercial in nature, you are subject to our Commercial and Branded Content Guidelines.
More simply put
These Terms are an agreement between you and us. You cannot use Pinterest if you're under 13 (or older in some countries). If you use Pinterest for commercial purposes, you need to set up a business account. If you post commercial, sponsored or branded content, you need to comply with our Commercial and Branded Content Guidelines. We grant you a revocable license to use Pinterest, which is subject to our Terms and policies as outlined immediately above. Unless we have agreed otherwise, if your account has been suspended you can’t return to Pinterest.
# 3. Your User Content
### a. Posting User Content
Pinterest allows you to post content, including photos, videos, comments, links, and other materials. For the purpose of these Terms, anything that you post or otherwise make available on Pinterest is referred to as "User Content." You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to Pinterest. All User Content must comply with these Terms and our policies, including our Community Guidelines.
You will only post User Content that you have the rights to post, and you won’t post User Content that infringes the intellectual property rights of others (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark infringement or counterfeit), or that is otherwise unlawful, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law. We can take action against User Content that violates these Terms or our policies or where we are permitted or required by law, such as by removing, restricting, or limiting access to, or distribution of, the content. We can also suspend or terminate accounts of users who repeatedly or seriously infringe third-party intellectual property rights, violate the law, these Terms, or our policies, or where permitted or required to do so by law. We are a neutral intermediary and we do not review all User Content before or after it is published on the Service, so we are not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Content posted by you or any other Pinterest user. For more information about how we enforce our policies or otherwise take action on content on Pinterest, see our Enforcement page. Where appropriate, you may appeal the decisions you think were made in error. You may have a right under local law to bring a claim for breach of contract if you believe we have breached these Terms by removing, restricting or limiting access to, or distribution of, your User Content, or suspending or terminating your account. Pinterest cannot provide you with legal advice.
More simply put
If you post your Content on Pinterest, it still belongs to you. In using Pinterest, you agree to only post User Content that follows these Terms and our policies, is lawful and doesn’t violate anyone else’s rights. If you post User Content that is infringing, illegal, or violates our Terms or policies, we can take action against the User Content and, where appropriate, your account. Where appropriate, you can appeal those actions.
### b. How we and other users can use your User Content
By providing any User Content on the Service, you grant us and our affiliates and service providers, and our users, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide license to use, store, publicly perform or display, reproduce, save, modify, create derivative works, monetize, download, translate and distribute your User Content, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Pinterest Service. Nothing in these Terms: (i) entitles you to any payments or the right to share in any revenue from any monetization of User Content; or (ii) restricts other legal rights we may have to User Content, for example under other licenses. We reserve the right to remove, limit distribution of, or modify User Content, or change the way it’s used in Pinterest. This not only includes User Content that we believe violates these Terms, but also our Community Guidelines, our Copyright Policy, our Trademark Policy or any of our other policies, or other circumstances where we feel such action is in the best interest of Pinterest or our Users.
Content recommendations on Pinterest are made based on a combination of factors. Your recommendations are mainly influenced by how you engage with our Service, the topics we think you’re interested in and how interested you are in them, and what other users who share your similar characteristics and interests like. The relative importance of these criteria is influenced by how you engage with our Service, including how often you engage, your saves, and your hides.
You can adjust how recommendations are made in your Privacy and Data Settings, and through your Home Feed Tuner.
More simply put
If you post your User Content on Pinterest, we can show it to people and others can use it and save it. Pinterest shows content to users based on a combination of factors, focusing on what we think you will find interesting. When content violates these Terms, we can take action on that content.
### c. How long we keep your User Content
Following termination or deactivation of your account, or User Content removal from Pinterest, we may keep your User Content for a reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. We and our users may retain and continue to use, store, display, reproduce, save, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute any of your User Content that you or other users have stored or shared on Pinterest.
More simply put
If you choose to post User Content, you give us permission to use it to provide and improve Pinterest. Copies of User Content shared with others may remain even if the User Content or your account have been deleted.
### d. Feedback you provide
We value hearing from our users and are always interested in learning about ways we can make Pinterest more awesome. If you choose to submit comments, ideas, or feedback, you agree that we have no obligation to keep your feedback confidential or to compensate you for the feedback. Do not submit any feedback that is confidential or owned by any third party. By accepting your submission, we don’t waive any rights to use similar or related feedback previously known to us, or developed by our employees, or obtained from sources other than you.
### e. Our reporting channels
Pinterest offers reporting channels that you may use to tell us about content on Pinterest that you think violates these Terms, our policies, or local law. We will review your report and take any appropriate action in a timely fashion. In using these channels, you agree to submit reports in good faith and not misuse any reporting or appeals channel by making baseless reports or appeals. Visit our Help Center to learn more about how to report content on Pinterest.
More simply put
We appreciate your feedback and will use your suggestions and reporting to make Pinterest better. You can report content on Pinterest you think violates our policies or the law.
# 4. Intellectual Property
### a. Copyright Policy and Trademark Policy
Pinterest has adopted and implemented our Copyright Policy and Trademark Policy in accordance with applicable intellectual property laws.
### b. Pinterest Intellectual Property
You acknowledge and agree that, as between you and us, we own all right, title and interest in and to Pinterest and all intellectual property rights (including but not limited to the copyrights, trademarks and patents) therein (the “Pinterest IP”) and you must not use any of the Pinterest IP, except as necessary for your permitted use of Pinterest. For clarity, Pinterest IP does not include User Content.
If you use Pinterest IP in breach of these Terms, your right to use Pinterest will terminate immediately and you must, at our option, return or destroy any copies of the Pinterest IP you have made. No right, title or interest in or to Pinterest or any Pinterest IP is transferred to you under these Terms, and we reserve all rights not expressly granted.
More simply put
We respect intellectual property, including copyrights and trademarks. You should, too.
# 5. Security
We care about the security of our users. While we work to protect the security of your User Content and account, we can’t guarantee that unauthorized third parties won’t be able to defeat our security measures. Keep your password secure and do not disclose it to any other person or entity. Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to your account or any other breach of security.
More simply put
You can help us keep your account and Pinterest secure by keeping these security tips in mind.
# 6. Third party links, sites, and services
Pinterest may contain links to third party websites, advertisers, services, software components, special offers or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by us. We don’t endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third party websites, information, materials, products or services. If you access any third party website, service or content, etc. from Pinterest, you do so at your own risk and you agree that we have no liability arising from your use of, purchase from or access to any third party website, service, or content, etc.
More simply put
We allow users to include links to content outside of Pinterest. We're not responsible for any content you view on, or your use of, third party websites or services.
# 7. Termination
We may terminate or suspend your right to access or use Pinterest for any violation of these Terms. Where appropriate, we will provide you with written notice and you may appeal a decision you think was made in error. For more information about how we enforce our policies or otherwise take action on content on Pinterest, see our Enforcement page.
You may also terminate or delete your account at any time. You can learn how to delete your account in our Help Center.
Upon termination, Sections 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of these Terms will continue to be operative.
More simply put
We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone and will provide notice of termination where appropriate.
# 8. Indemnity
If you use Pinterest for commercial purposes without agreeing to our Business Terms as required by Section 2(c) of these Terms, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Pinterest, Inc., Pinterest Europe Ltd., and their affiliates from any claims (including reasonable attorney’s fees) relating to your use of our Service. Pinterest reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification, in which event you will fully cooperate with Pinterest.
More simply put
If you are a business user and Pinterest is sued because of your use of the Service, you’re financially responsible.
# 9. Disclaimers
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Service and all content on Pinterest is provided on an "as is" basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.
Pinterest specifically disclaims any and all warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.
Pinterest takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other person or third party posts or sends using the Service. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that's inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose.
We do not warrant that Pinterest or any portion of the Service, or any materials or content offered through Pinterest, are accurate, complete, or current, or will be uninterrupted, secure, or free of errors, viruses, or other harmful components.
We may make changes to Pinterest for various reasons. We will have no liability for any change to Pinterest or any suspension or termination of your access to, or use of Pinterest.
The limitations, exclusions, and disclaimers in this section apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.  
More simply put
We work every day to improve our Service, and we hope you love it. We may make changes to Pinterest from time to time and for various reasons - including adding, removing or changing features and how our Service works. But services like Pinterest aren't perfect, and you agree to use ours 'as is,' without warranties.
# 10. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (b) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service, including without limitation, any defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of other users or third parties; or (c) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content.
In no event shall our aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Service exceed one hundred U.S. dollars (U.S. $100.00). The foregoing does not affect any liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.
If we cause damage to you and you're a consumer in the EEA or UK, the above doesn't apply. Instead, Pinterest's liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. Pinterest isn't liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability won't apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct, or to exclude our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you.  
More simply put
We are building the best Service we can, but it won't always be perfect. We're not liable for various losses or damages.
# 11. Arbitration
If you are a consumer in the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (UK), Section 11 doesn't apply to you.
For any dispute you have with us, you agree to first contact us and try to resolve the dispute informally. To the extent permitted by law, neither party may initiate any legal proceeding—whether in court, arbitration, or any other forum—until the Notice of Dispute and Informal Dispute Resolution processes described below are completed. Nothing in this Section, however, will prevent either you or us from seeking temporary injunctive relief in court (or in arbitration) to preserve the status quo or to help enforce this arbitration clause at the outset of any dispute.
A party with a dispute must first send us a Notice of Dispute, which must include your full name; your Pinterest profile name (which begins @); the email address associated with your Pinterest account; your country of residence and, if you are a U.S. resident, your state of residence; your counsel, if you are represented by counsel; a detailed description of both the dispute and the alleged harm; and your signature. That information should be emailed to litigation@pinterest.com. The notice can only be sent on behalf of an individual party; a Notice of Dispute that asserts the rights of more than one party is ineffective. After receiving the Notice of Dispute, Pinterest will respond within 60 days to attempt to resolve the dispute amicably. After the 60-day period has elapsed, either party may initiate arbitration.
**Arbitration** : If we haven’t been able to resolve the dispute through the mandatory processes above, you and we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service through binding arbitration or, for qualifying claims, in small claims court. The arbitrator will have authority to issue any remedies authorized by law.
Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court. By accepting these Terms, you agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section, and that you and Pinterest are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitrator also has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement, including any dispute regarding arbitrability.
Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the applicable rules then in effect for the AAA. If the AAA rules conflict in any way with these Terms, the Terms will govern. You can find AAA’s forms at www.adr.org. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. A judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Where the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules apply, if the arbitrator determines that a party’s claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, the arbitrator must assign all fees and costs associated with the arbitration to that party.
All disputes must be brought in the party's individual capacity, and not as a member in any class or representative proceeding. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
Nothing in these Terms shall affect any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to you. To the extent any dispute isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise, you agree that the dispute will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms.
**Batched Arbitration** : To provide a more efficient arbitration process, you and we each agree that if 25 or more similar arbitration demands are filed within a 60-day period or with the assistance of the same law firm or group of law firms, AAA will consolidate the arbitration demands. For each batch, AAA will administer one set of filing and administrative fees per side, per batch, and AAA will appoint one arbitrator to resolve each batch as a single consolidated arbitration. Arbitration demands are similar if they arise from similar facts and raise similar legal issues while seeking similar relief. Any dispute about similarity will be submitted to a single arbitrator, whose fees will be paid by us.
More simply put
You agree to notify us of any dispute and try to resolve it amicably. If that doesn’t work, the dispute will be efficiently decided through arbitration, not in court.
# 12. Governing law and jurisdiction
If you are a consumer in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, these Terms and your use of the Service shall be governed by the law of the country where you live, and any claim, dispute, or controversy arising from or in connection with or relating to these Terms, Pinterest, or the Service shall be resolved in the courts of the country where you live.
In all other cases, these Terms and your use of the Service shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. For any actions not subject to Section 11 (Arbitration), the exclusive place of jurisdiction for any claim, dispute, or controversy arising from or in connection with these Terms or the Service is San Francisco County, California, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and such disputes will be determined under California law.
More simply put
The Bay Area is beautiful this time of year. It doesn't matter what time of year it is, that's what's so great! Let’s resolve any disputes in California. If you are a consumer in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, however, you can file disputes in your home courts.
# 13. General terms
### a. Notification procedures and changes to these Terms
We may revise, add, or remove any or all portions of these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. Unless otherwise required by law, we’ll notify you of any material changes to these Terms before any update enters into effect. Your continued access to or use of Pinterest after such an update constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the version of these Terms in place at the time the dispute arose. For clarity, by continuing to use Pinterest, you are agreeing to be bound by the then-current version of these Terms.
More simply put
If we're making a material change to the Terms, we'll let you know ahead of time. If you don’t agree with the new Terms, please stop using Pinterest.
### b. Assignment
If you’re a consumer in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, either you or we may assign this agreement, and any rights and licenses granted under it, to a third party. In all other cases, these Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.
In case of such an assignment by us, you are entitled to terminate the agreement with immediate effect by deactivating your account. We will provide you with reasonable notice of any such assignment.
### c. Entire agreement/severability
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
### d. No waiver
No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
### e. Parties
If you live in the United States, these Terms are a contract between you and Pinterest, Inc., 651 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. If you live outside the United States, these Terms are a contract between you and Pinterest Europe Ltd., an Irish company with its registered office at Waterloo Exchange, 3rd Floor, Waterloo Road, Dublin 4, Ireland. As Pinterest is a worldwide service, you agree that any rights and licenses granted hereunder benefit Pinterest, Inc. and all of its worldwide subsidiaries and affiliates.
More simply put
Who you deal with depends on where you live.
Effective date: April 30, 2025

O coração de uma casa, sempre é a cozinha! Nesse projeto priorizamos a funcionalidade da cozinha analisando o acervo de louças dos clientes, aumentamos as áreas de bancada, criamos um nicho específico para os eletros como microondas, air fryer e ainda conseguimos um cantinho para a cafeteira. Criamos uma cristaleira para as louças especiais da família, criamos também uma estante compacta para expor decorações a pedido da cliente, que ficou um charme a parte nessa cozinha! Tons neutros…

State Privacy Law Disclosures and Notice at Collection
Some U.S. states have enacted privacy laws that grant their residents certain rights and require specific disclosures (“State Privacy Laws”). This page supplements our Privacy Policy and applies to you if you reside in a state governed by a State Privacy Law, such as California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, Montana, Texas, Utah, or Virginia. This page also serves as our California Notice at Collection.
The tables and descriptions that follow explain the info in our Privacy Policy. The table immediately below uses categories required under some of the State Privacy Laws to explain our general collection, use, and disclosure activities. Following that, we explain our advertising activities, the rights you have under the State Privacy laws, and metrics about how we handle rights requests. As explained in our Privacy Policy, children under 13 are not allowed to use Pinterest.
# Collection, Use and Disclosure Overview
Categories of Personal Information
Purposes for Collecting, Using, and Disclosing
Recipients of Information  
  * Identifiers, such as your name, username, email address, phone number, unique device identifiers, and your IP address

  * Electronic, visual, or similar information, such as your profile picture or photos
  * Professional or employment information, when you link your account to other accounts

We have collected this information from you, your devices, our partners, advertisers, and other third parties.
We do not collect or process sensitive personal information about you for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you.
We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide the Pinterest services to you and fulfill the purposes described here and in our Privacy Policy. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.
# Advertising Activities
To help personalize the ads we and our partners show you on and off Pinterest, and to advertise Pinterest services to you on third-party sites and services, we engage in activities that may qualify as “sharing,” “selling,” or processing personal information for “targeted advertising” under the State Privacy Laws.
For example, we use personal information, including information we receive from ad partners and other third parties to decide which ads to show you on and off Pinterest, and we disclose info about you and your Pinterest activity to improve the ads you're shown on Pinterest through our third-party ad network partners. We provide info about your Pinterest activity with advertisers to help them measure how their ads perform. We also disclose personal information to third-party services and advertising partners to reach you with ads about Pinterest on those third-party services.

  * Identifiers, like your IP address, mobile advertising ID, cookie ID, or hashed versions of your email address
  * Internet or electronic network activity information, including data about actions you take on the Pinterest services
  * Inferences we draw about your interests or preferences


  * Advertising networks
  * Advertisers
  * Data analytics providers
  * Social networks

  
We will obtain your opt-in consent for activities described in this section where required by a State Privacy law, and we do not knowingly “share” or “sell” information about California users under 16.
# Your rights under the State Privacy Laws

  * **Right to Delete**. You may submit a verifiable request that we delete Personal Information we have collected from you.
  * **Right to Opt-out of Sales/Sharing/Targeted Advertising**. You have the right to opt out of activities that may be considered “sharing,” “sales,” or processing personal information for “targeted advertising” under the State Privacy Laws, which you can do by following the instructions provided in the “Privacy and Data” section of your settings menu. If you have an account with us and you visit our site with an opt-out preference signal (such as Global Privacy Control) enabled, we will treat this as an opt-out request.
  * **Appeal**. If we deny your request to exercise any of the above-mentioned rights, you may appeal our decision by following the instructions we provide in our response to you or send an email to privacy-support@pinterest.com. If you have concerns about the results of an appeal, you may contact the attorney general in the state where you reside.
  * **Right to Equal Service**. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.


In order to verify your identity when you make a request, you will be required to log in to your password-protected account or respond to an email verification request.
To exercise these rights, please visit your account settings, and if you still need help visit our Help Center or contact us at privacy-support@pinterest.com.
In addition to exercising these rights yourself, you may also designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. If the authorized agent does not provide a valid power of attorney, we will ask you to verify the request directly via email or through your password-protected account.

First, get a free business account. Then, check out our guide to getting started for tips about business tools and features.

For example, you’ll gain access to ads, analytics and custom audience insights. Business accounts are free, and you can set your own budget if you decide to run ads. 


Should I have a separate Pinterest account for my business?

    
A business account gives you access to powerful tools like ads and analytics. These features aren’t available on a standard Pinterest account, so you’ll want to make sure you’re using a business account for any marketing goals. If you already have a personal account, you can convert it to a business account in a few simple steps. Or, you can sign up for a new account if you prefer to keep your personal and work accounts separate. 


What are the benefits of using Pinterest for my business? 

    
People come to Pinterest with an open mind. They’re excited to find new brands and products to shop. With a Pinterest business account, you can get in front of the audience you care about at any stage along this journey—then help guide them into purchasing.  


Is it easy to sell on Pinterest? 

    
Shopping features are designed into many parts of our platform. This means your products will fit right into people’s experience, instead of feeling out of place. You can learn more about shopping ads and products on our dedicated page.

Privacy Policy
# State Privacy Law Disclosure & Notice at Collection
**ThisU.S. State Privacy Law Disclosure & Notice at Collection applies only if you are a resident of a U.S. state governed by a state-level privacy law. This page also serves as our California Notice at Collection.**
# Summary of changes
We work hard to make our use of personal data transparent and to make your rights and choices easy to understand. We added more details on how we train the models that support our products and services including those using generative artificial intelligence, how long we keep your information, and changes to our international data transfer mechanisms. If you are outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, we’ve outlined how we may share data with partners to allow advertisers to reach you on other websites and apps.
# Thank you for using Pinterest!
Our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. To do that, we show you personalized content and ads we think you’ll be interested in based on information we collect from you and other parties.
We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it. Some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.  
  

# Scope of the Privacy Policy
This is Pinterest’s global Privacy Policy. We have highlighted below where a particular section applies to you based on where you live.
For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR** ”), if you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK, Pinterest Europe Ltd. and Pinterest, Inc. are joint data controllers of your personal data. Pinterest Europe Ltd. is an Irish company with its registered office at Waterloo Exchange, 3rd Floor, Waterloo Road, Dublin 4, Ireland. Pinterest, Inc. is a US company with its registered office at 651 Brannan St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. Pinterest Europe Ltd is the responsible controller for fulfilling key obligations under the GDPR. If you have any questions about our data processing activities, please contact our Data Protection Officer.
# We collect information in a few different ways
### 1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it
When you use Pinterest websites, apps, services, technologies, APIs, widgets, or any other products, like Shuffles, or features we offer (“Pinterest” or the “Services”), you voluntarily share certain information.
  * **Account Information** : When you join our Services, we collect information like your name, email address, birthday, gender, country of residence, your interests, and preferred language. If you have a business account, depending on where you live, you may also have the option to add race and ethnicity information to your profile.
  * **Content** : We collect information when you save or upload Pins, photos, or other content, interact with Pins or other content (for example, commenting or adding a Pin), or where you send messages and interact with other users.
  * **Precise location information** : Depending on where you live, you can choose to share your precise location using your device settings.
  * **Your communications with us** : If you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, we collect the content of these communications.
  * **Your contacts** : If you previously chose to sync your contacts with your account, we will continue to process certain information about your contacts who are Pinterest users to help you find one another on our Services.


### 2. We also get technical information when you use Pinterest
When you use a website, mobile application or other internet service, certain internet and electronic network activity information gets created and logged automatically. This is also true when you use Pinterest. Here are some of the types of information we collect:
  * **Device information** : We collect information about the device you use to access our Services, including the type of device, operating system, network service provider, settings, and unique device identifiers.
  * **Log data** : When you use our Services, our servers record information (“log data”), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you’re using it. This log data includes, for example, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, activity on websites you visit that incorporate Pinterest features (like the “Save” button) browser type and settings, and the date and time of when you accessed the Services. You can learn more about the log data we collect here.
  * **Information from cookies and similar technologies** : We also use “cookies” or similar technologies to obtain log data. For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest. For more information about how we use cookies, please review our Cookie Policy.
  * **Usage data and inferences** : When you’re on our Services, we use your activity—such as which Pins you click on, terms you search for, boards you create, and any text that you add in a comment or description—along with other information you’ve provided when you first signed up and information from our partners and advertisers to make inferences about you and your preferences. For example, if you create a board about travel, we may infer you are a travel enthusiast. We may also infer other information, such as your education or professional experience.
  * **Location Information** : We use your IP address to infer your approximate location, even if you don't choose to share your precise location, and photos you share may include information about the location where they were taken.
  * **User Choices** : We will keep a record of choices you’ve selected in your settings, including privacy settings and whether you have enabled notifications.


### 3. Our partners and advertisers share information with us
We also receive information about you and your activity outside Pinterest from our affiliates, advertisers, partners and other third parties we work with. For example:
  * **Third party platforms** : If you register for or log into the Service using a third party platform (like Facebook or Google), they will furnish certain information to us to facilitate your account creation or log-in with us. In addition, if you connect your third-party accounts to our Services, we may use information from those accounts to improve your experience. Further, some third-party applications use Pinterest features such as our “Save” button, or you may install our “Save” button for your browser. If so, we collect log data from those sites or apps, including usage data.
  * **Technical service partners** : We sometimes receive information about you from technical service partners, including from marketing firms.
  * **Advertisers or other partners** : Online advertisers or third parties provide information to us about you to measure, report on or improve the performance of ads on Pinterest, or to help us better understand what kinds of ads to show you on Pinterest. For example, we may receive information about your visits to an advertiser's site, or purchases you made from them, or information about your interests from a third-party service, which we might use to help show you ads on the Service. Sometimes we get this information through the Pinterest Tag (a piece of code an advertiser puts on their site), which delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on our Services. Learn more about the Pinterest Tag and the types of information advertisers or other third parties share with us.


You can control how we use this information to personalize your experience and the ads you see on Pinterest in your Privacy and Data Settings.
# How we use the info we collect
**We’re committed to showing you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you. To do that, we use your information to provide and improve your experience, including to:**
  * Identify you when you use our Services.
  * Recommend Pins, boards, or content you might like based on your activity on our Services and your offsite behavior. For example, if we see you’re into cooking-related ads or content on Pinterest, we may suggest food-related Pins to you. Similarly, if you visit websites that sell electric guitars, we may suggest guitar Pins to you. For more information on how we recommend content to you, please visit our Terms of Service.
  * Respond to your questions or comments.
  * Build your community on our Services. We use your info to suggest other people who have similar interests. For example, if you follow interior design boards, we may suggest interior designers that you might like. We also use data to help your friends and contacts find you on Pinterest. For example, people can search for your account on Pinterest using your email. If you previously chose to sync your contacts with your Pinterest account, we will process certain information about your contacts who are Pinterest users to help you find them on our Services.
  * Allow searching with photos, if you choose. For example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.
  * Depending on where you live, and with your consent, identify your precise location and customize your experience on our Services. For example, if we know that you’re near a retailer we may show you that retailer’s Pins that may be of interest to you. You can opt in to (and out of) this in your device operating system settings.
  * Send you updates, including by email, push notification, SMS, or phone. You can unsubscribe from our promotional emails at any time and decide to stop getting other notifications by updating your settings.


**We use your information in our efforts to improve our Services, keep our users and the public safe, and to protect legal interests. To do so, we:**
  * Review your activity and messages on our Services to detect spam, enforce our Terms and policies, or activity that poses a risk to our community or the public. This can include working with law enforcement to keep Pinterest safe.
  * Analyze users’ log data and device information to identify and investigate suspicious behavior or violations of our policies or Terms.
  * Conduct age verification, as appropriate. This may include facial age estimation and matching your face against a government ID.
  * May access user information in relation to a legal claim, litigation, or regulatory proceeding.
  * Conduct analytics and research on who is using our Services and what they are doing. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature on Pinterest, we can understand which version is better.
  * Improve the products and services of our family of companies and offer new features. For example, using information to train, develop and improve our technology such as our machine learning models, regardless of when Pins were posted. This includes, for example, Pinterest’s body type technology, which is trained on images in Pins posted to our Services. Pinterest also has features that are supported by generative artificial intelligence technology. Learn more here.
  * Create aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. Pinterest processes, maintains, and uses this information only in a de-identified fashion for the purposes of this Privacy Policy and will not attempt to re-identify such information.


**We also use your information to personalize the ads you see**
Specifically, we use the information we collect to:
  * Decide which ads to show you directly on Pinterest, and, depending on where you live, enabling Pinterest directly or through partners to show you ads both on and off Pinterest. For example, if you show an interest in camping tents on Pinterest or browse sleeping bags on one of our partner’s websites, we may show you ads for other outdoor products. Depending on your age, location and privacy settings, we customize the ads we show you by identifying your interests based on your onsite and offsite activities, as well as by using information we receive from ad partners or other third parties. We also offer features supported by generative artificial intelligence to enable our advertisers to add limited content to their ads. Where we use cookies to identify your offsite interests, we’ll get your consent where required.
  * Advertise Pinterest products and services to you on other sites and apps. To do this, we disclose information such as cookie IDs, your IP address, or a hashed version of your email address to third parties, such as Facebook Ads, Google Marketing Platform, and others who may combine that information with other information they already have about you and deliver ads about Pinterest to you. Learn more about our marketing practices off Pinterest and how to opt-out.
  * Tell our ad partners how their Pinterest ads are doing, and how to make them better. We disclose information about the ads you see or interact with on Pinterest to our advertisers and third-party companies to improve the performance of the ads that we or they use to measure or improve the delivery and performance of ads or content on websites and apps. Some of this information is aggregated. For example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed a Pin went on to visit that advertiser's site. Depending on where you live and your settings, we may also disclose this information at an individual level. For example, we would let an advertiser know that a particular Pin has been saved by certain people. To find out more about reporting on ads please visit the Help Center.


Some of these activities may be considered “targeted advertising” “sharing” or “selling” as those terms are defined under certain state privacy laws in the US. You can opt out of Pinterest using and disclosing your information for these purposes. To do so, visit your Privacy and Data Settings.
When we use cookies to learn about your behavior on or off of our services, we or our partners will obtain consent that we may need under applicable law. To find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.

  * Accessing, storing, preserving, or sharing information when we think it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including sharing with researchers, law enforcement, or other authorities.
  * To deal with and resolve requests and complaints. We retain correspondence relating to data subject requests under GDPR for two years, in case those requests are not resolved and this correspondence is required in order to handle any resulting complaints. In such cases, the correspondence is then retained while those complaints are being resolved.


**Examples of laws that can require us to process information in the above way include:**
  * Regulatory matters: to comply with regulatory obligations like under privacy laws (GDPR) and the Digital Services Act (DSA).
  * Civil, commercial, criminal, or consumer protection matters: where we are in receipt of a court order to disclose information for the purposes of court proceedings or regulatory inquiries (e.g. orders or mandatory requests under the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, GDPR).
  * Corporate and taxation matters: obligations such as the Irish Companies Act 2014 and the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.


**Issues relating to the safety of our Service and to protect rights, property and users**
  * We keep information where it is necessary to investigate misuse of our Services, such as spam and other bad experiences. If we disable an account for violating our Terms, we also preserve information about that user for safety, security and integrity purposes.

  * Lead ads. If you submit information via a lead ad form (for example, to sign up for an advertiser’s mailing list or for a consultation), we will share that information with the advertiser as described on the form.
  * Promotion of Creators. If you choose to provide race or ethnicity information we will use it to promote you as a Creator, for example during Black History Month, or reach out to you about events.


## Information categories used

Note that you will still see ads on our Services, but they will not be informed by offsite data.

If you live in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, you also have some additional rights:

    * In the UK, the relevant data protection authority is the Information Commissioner's Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF, +44 (0303) 123 1113, email: casework@ico.org.uk.
    * In Ireland, the relevant data protection authority is the Data Protection Commission, 21 Fitzwilliam Square South, Dublin 2, D02 RD28, +353 017650100 / + 353 1800437737, email: info@dataprotection.ie or by using the following online form: Forms for Data Protection.


For any of the privacy rights and choices referenced, you can also submit a request to our DPO regarding the use and disclosure of your information.
We will not discriminate against you if you choose to exercise your rights or options related to your personal information. These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, where they would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interest to keep. If we deny your request to exercise your rights, you may have the right to appeal our decision by contacting us using privacy-support@pinterest.com.
You have choices regarding your information on Pinterest. If you have a Pinterest account, many of these controls are built directly into Pinterest or your settings. For example, you can: Edit information in your profile, Link or unlink your Pinterest account from other services (like Facebook or Google), Edit secret board settings, and Close your account at any time. We also support settings such as tracking settings on iOS and Android devices.
You may also have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Pinterest. For example:
  * The browser you use may let you control cookies or other types of local data storage.
  * Your mobile device lets you choose how and whether your precise location, photos, and other data is shared with us.


For users who reside in certain U.S. states and have enabled an opt-out preferences signal (such as Global Privacy Control), we will respect this preference when you use Pinterest.
# How and when we share information
Anyone can see the public content you post, such as boards and Pins you create and public profile information you give us. Depending on where you live, we also make this public information available through what are called APIs (a technical way to share information quickly). For example, a partner can study what their most popular Pins are or how their Pins are being shared on Pinterest by using a Pinterest API. We also share the categories of information described above:
  * With other services, at your direction. For example, when you decide to link your Pinterest account to third party services, or when you publish your content on Pinterest to such services, you direct disclosure of certain information to those services. Creators may direct us to share information with advertisers or other partners for paid engagements.
  * Depending on where you live, and your privacy settings, we share data for advertising and related purposes, including showing you ads about Pinterest on third-party services, enabling partners to show you ads both on and off Pinterest, and helping advertisers understand how ads on Pinterest perform. For example, when you fill out a lead ad form, or click on an ad on Pinterest, we’ll share information related to that action with advertising partners. We may also provide partners with information about you so that advertisers can show you ads on or off of Pinterest. Learn more about how we support third-party advertising and the settings you have to manage it here.
  * With vendors that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam. Some information we acquire may be collected by vendors on our behalf.
  * With law enforcement agencies, government agencies, researchers, or other parties in compliance with laws, rules, or regulations. For example, we may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts. We only disclose information in response to such requests if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Pinterest; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. We may also share information if we believe it is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person in emergency situations. To find out more about how we respond to law enforcement requests, please see our Law Enforcement Guidelines. We may share your publicly accessible information with independent researchers who meet certain criteria, to combat societal harms.
  * With our corporate family of companies, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Privacy Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser).


# Transferring your information
Pinterest is a worldwide service. By using our products or services, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal information in such countries may not be equivalent to those of your home country.
Additional steps for data transfers in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK
If you live in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we take additional steps related to data transfers. Information controlled by Pinterest Europe Limited will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. Safeguards which we rely on in ensuring your information benefits from an adequate level of protection includes the following:
  * Adequacy decisions. These are decisions issued from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “How we use the info we collect” to some countries with such adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed here; or
  * Data Privacy Frameworks. For transfers of personal data of EEA, Switzerland, and UK (and Gibraltar) residents to the U.S., Pinterest relies on and has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to: the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK (and Gibraltar) Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (UK Extension), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (together the Data Privacy Frameworks). Pinterest, Inc. complies with Data Privacy Frameworks. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/. The Data Privacy Frameworks are discussed in more detail below.
  * Standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”). The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for Switzerland and the UK) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “How we use the info we collect” to third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.


While transfers to countries that don’t have an adequacy decision typically take place on the basis of SCCs, in certain circumstances, transfers can also take place on the basis of exemptions provided under data protection law. For example, sharing with law enforcement, in emergency situations where we learn that a person’s life is at risk.
We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:
  * technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation; and
  * policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests.


For a copy of these adequacy decisions or SCCs, please contact us via the details provided in the Contact us section below.
#### More information on the Data Privacy Frameworks
In compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks, Pinterest, Inc. commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your information. EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the Data Privacy Frameworks should first contact Pinterest Inc. at privacy-support@pinterest.com.
Pinterest, Inc. commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the Data Privacy Frameworks to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Pinterest, Inc.’s compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks. Under certain conditions, it may be possible to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, see here for additional information.
Pinterest, Inc. remains responsible if its agent, when acting on its behalf, processes personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
# How long we keep your information
We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Pinterest to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't use it to identify you.
Additional information if you live in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK
We keep your information only so long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, which include providing our Service, or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, or protecting or defending our rights, property and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the following factors:
  * **The nature of the information and why it is collected and processed:** The length of time we will keep your information will generally be determined by how long we need that information to provide you with our Services, including any optional features you use and to provide customer support. For example:
    * We keep account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account.
    * We keep content such as information when you save or upload Pins, photos, or other content, interact with Pins or other content, for as long as it is necessary to process it for the purpose for which it was collected.
    * We keep your communications with us (for example, where you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us) for a period of 2 years.
    * We generally keep log data for a period of 25 months to provide our Services to you, to make Pinterest safe, improve our product features, and to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting and personal to you.
  * **Legal and regulatory reasons:** In certain cases, we also keep your information for legal and regulatory reasons, including after your Pinterest account has been deleted. For example:
    * **For litigation or regulatory matters:** For example, we retain information for as long as we need it for a legal claim, litigation or regulatory proceeding.
    * **To handle and resolve requests and complaints:** We retain correspondence relating to data subject requests under GDPR for two years, in case those requests are not resolved and this correspondence is required in order to handle any resulting complaints. In such cases, the correspondence is then retained while those complaints are being resolved. When a user submits a complaint to Pinterest, Pinterest retains limited personal data of the complainant which includes their name, username, and user id associated with their email, plus the content of support tickets for two years.
    * **To respond to requests from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts:** For example, we retain/preserve your information for as long as is reasonably necessary where we receive a legal request for example a preservation order or search warrant related to your account.


# Our policy on children's information
Children under 13 are not allowed to use Pinterest. If you are based in a state or country with an older age requirement, you may only use the Services if you are at or over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing. Please visit the Help Center for more information.
# How we make changes to this policy
We may change this policy from time to time and if we do, we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Pinterest after those changes are in effect, the new policy applies to you. If the changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice, such as by sending you an email.
# Contact us
The best way to get in touch with us or to exercise your options described above is through the Help Center. If you live in the United States, Pinterest, Inc. is responsible for your information. You can contact Pinterest Inc. at 651 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.

Privacy Policy
# State Privacy Law Disclosure & Notice at Collection
**ThisU.S. State Privacy Law Disclosure & Notice at Collection applies only if you are a resident of a U.S. state governed by a state-level privacy law. This page also serves as our California Notice at Collection.**
# Summary of changes
We work hard to make our use of personal data transparent and to make your rights and choices easy to understand. We added more details on how we train the models that support our products and services including those using generative artificial intelligence, how long we keep your information, and changes to our international data transfer mechanisms. If you are outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, we’ve outlined how we may share data with partners to allow advertisers to reach you on other websites and apps.
# Thank you for using Pinterest!
Our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love. To do that, we show you personalized content and ads we think you’ll be interested in based on information we collect from you and other parties.
We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it. Some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.  
  

# Scope of the Privacy Policy
This is Pinterest’s global Privacy Policy. We have highlighted below where a particular section applies to you based on where you live.
For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR** ”), if you are a resident in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK, Pinterest Europe Ltd. and Pinterest, Inc. are joint data controllers of your personal data. Pinterest Europe Ltd. is an Irish company with its registered office at Waterloo Exchange, 3rd Floor, Waterloo Road, Dublin 4, Ireland. Pinterest, Inc. is a US company with its registered office at 651 Brannan St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. Pinterest Europe Ltd is the responsible controller for fulfilling key obligations under the GDPR. If you have any questions about our data processing activities, please contact our Data Protection Officer.
# We collect information in a few different ways
### 1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it
When you use Pinterest websites, apps, services, technologies, APIs, widgets, or any other products, like Shuffles, or features we offer (“Pinterest” or the “Services”), you voluntarily share certain information.
  * **Account Information** : When you join our Services, we collect information like your name, email address, birthday, gender, country of residence, your interests, and preferred language. If you have a business account, depending on where you live, you may also have the option to add race and ethnicity information to your profile.
  * **Content** : We collect information when you save or upload Pins, photos, or other content, interact with Pins or other content (for example, commenting or adding a Pin), or where you send messages and interact with other users.
  * **Precise location information** : Depending on where you live, you can choose to share your precise location using your device settings.
  * **Your communications with us** : If you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us, we collect the content of these communications.
  * **Your contacts** : If you previously chose to sync your contacts with your account, we will continue to process certain information about your contacts who are Pinterest users to help you find one another on our Services.


### 2. We also get technical information when you use Pinterest
When you use a website, mobile application or other internet service, certain internet and electronic network activity information gets created and logged automatically. This is also true when you use Pinterest. Here are some of the types of information we collect:
  * **Device information** : We collect information about the device you use to access our Services, including the type of device, operating system, network service provider, settings, and unique device identifiers.
  * **Log data** : When you use our Services, our servers record information (“log data”), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you’re using it. This log data includes, for example, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, activity on websites you visit that incorporate Pinterest features (like the “Save” button) browser type and settings, and the date and time of when you accessed the Services. You can learn more about the log data we collect here.
  * **Information from cookies and similar technologies** : We also use “cookies” or similar technologies to obtain log data. For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest. For more information about how we use cookies, please review our Cookie Policy.
  * **Usage data and inferences** : When you’re on our Services, we use your activity—such as which Pins you click on, terms you search for, boards you create, and any text that you add in a comment or description—along with other information you’ve provided when you first signed up and information from our partners and advertisers to make inferences about you and your preferences. For example, if you create a board about travel, we may infer you are a travel enthusiast. We may also infer other information, such as your education or professional experience.
  * **Location Information** : We use your IP address to infer your approximate location, even if you don't choose to share your precise location, and photos you share may include information about the location where they were taken.
  * **User Choices** : We will keep a record of choices you’ve selected in your settings, including privacy settings and whether you have enabled notifications.


### 3. Our partners and advertisers share information with us
We also receive information about you and your activity outside Pinterest from our affiliates, advertisers, partners and other third parties we work with. For example:
  * **Third party platforms** : If you register for or log into the Service using a third party platform (like Facebook or Google), they will furnish certain information to us to facilitate your account creation or log-in with us. In addition, if you connect your third-party accounts to our Services, we may use information from those accounts to improve your experience. Further, some third-party applications use Pinterest features such as our “Save” button, or you may install our “Save” button for your browser. If so, we collect log data from those sites or apps, including usage data.
  * **Technical service partners** : We sometimes receive information about you from technical service partners, including from marketing firms.
  * **Advertisers or other partners** : Online advertisers or third parties provide information to us about you to measure, report on or improve the performance of ads on Pinterest, or to help us better understand what kinds of ads to show you on Pinterest. For example, we may receive information about your visits to an advertiser's site, or purchases you made from them, or information about your interests from a third-party service, which we might use to help show you ads on the Service. Sometimes we get this information through the Pinterest Tag (a piece of code an advertiser puts on their site), which delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on our Services. Learn more about the Pinterest Tag and the types of information advertisers or other third parties share with us.


You can control how we use this information to personalize your experience and the ads you see on Pinterest in your Privacy and Data Settings.
# How we use the info we collect
**We’re committed to showing you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you. To do that, we use your information to provide and improve your experience, including to:**
  * Identify you when you use our Services.
  * Recommend Pins, boards, or content you might like based on your activity on our Services and your offsite behavior. For example, if we see you’re into cooking-related ads or content on Pinterest, we may suggest food-related Pins to you. Similarly, if you visit websites that sell electric guitars, we may suggest guitar Pins to you. For more information on how we recommend content to you, please visit our Terms of Service.
  * Respond to your questions or comments.
  * Build your community on our Services. We use your info to suggest other people who have similar interests. For example, if you follow interior design boards, we may suggest interior designers that you might like. We also use data to help your friends and contacts find you on Pinterest. For example, people can search for your account on Pinterest using your email. If you previously chose to sync your contacts with your Pinterest account, we will process certain information about your contacts who are Pinterest users to help you find them on our Services.
  * Allow searching with photos, if you choose. For example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.
  * Depending on where you live, and with your consent, identify your precise location and customize your experience on our Services. For example, if we know that you’re near a retailer we may show you that retailer’s Pins that may be of interest to you. You can opt in to (and out of) this in your device operating system settings.
  * Send you updates, including by email, push notification, SMS, or phone. You can unsubscribe from our promotional emails at any time and decide to stop getting other notifications by updating your settings.


**We use your information in our efforts to improve our Services, keep our users and the public safe, and to protect legal interests. To do so, we:**
  * Review your activity and messages on our Services to detect spam, enforce our Terms and policies, or activity that poses a risk to our community or the public. This can include working with law enforcement to keep Pinterest safe.
  * Analyze users’ log data and device information to identify and investigate suspicious behavior or violations of our policies or Terms.
  * Conduct age verification, as appropriate. This may include facial age estimation and matching your face against a government ID.
  * May access user information in relation to a legal claim, litigation, or regulatory proceeding.
  * Conduct analytics and research on who is using our Services and what they are doing. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature on Pinterest, we can understand which version is better.
  * Improve the products and services of our family of companies and offer new features. For example, using information to train, develop and improve our technology such as our machine learning models, regardless of when Pins were posted. This includes, for example, Pinterest’s body type technology, which is trained on images in Pins posted to our Services. Pinterest also has features that are supported by generative artificial intelligence technology. Learn more here.
  * Create aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. Pinterest processes, maintains, and uses this information only in a de-identified fashion for the purposes of this Privacy Policy and will not attempt to re-identify such information.


**We also use your information to personalize the ads you see**
Specifically, we use the information we collect to:
  * Decide which ads to show you directly on Pinterest, and, depending on where you live, enabling Pinterest directly or through partners to show you ads both on and off Pinterest. For example, if you show an interest in camping tents on Pinterest or browse sleeping bags on one of our partner’s websites, we may show you ads for other outdoor products. Depending on your age, location and privacy settings, we customize the ads we show you by identifying your interests based on your onsite and offsite activities, as well as by using information we receive from ad partners or other third parties. We also offer features supported by generative artificial intelligence to enable our advertisers to add limited content to their ads. Where we use cookies to identify your offsite interests, we’ll get your consent where required.
  * Advertise Pinterest products and services to you on other sites and apps. To do this, we disclose information such as cookie IDs, your IP address, or a hashed version of your email address to third parties, such as Facebook Ads, Google Marketing Platform, and others who may combine that information with other information they already have about you and deliver ads about Pinterest to you. Learn more about our marketing practices off Pinterest and how to opt-out.
  * Tell our ad partners how their Pinterest ads are doing, and how to make them better. We disclose information about the ads you see or interact with on Pinterest to our advertisers and third-party companies to improve the performance of the ads that we or they use to measure or improve the delivery and performance of ads or content on websites and apps. Some of this information is aggregated. For example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed a Pin went on to visit that advertiser's site. Depending on where you live and your settings, we may also disclose this information at an individual level. For example, we would let an advertiser know that a particular Pin has been saved by certain people. To find out more about reporting on ads please visit the Help Center.


Some of these activities may be considered “targeted advertising” “sharing” or “selling” as those terms are defined under certain state privacy laws in the US. You can opt out of Pinterest using and disclosing your information for these purposes. To do so, visit your Privacy and Data Settings.
When we use cookies to learn about your behavior on or off of our services, we or our partners will obtain consent that we may need under applicable law. To find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.

## To deliver advertising that is relevant, interesting and personal on our Services, we:
  * Decide which ads to show you based on information on our Services. For example, if you show an interest in camping tents on Pinterest, we may show you ads for other outdoor products. We also offer features supported by generative artificial intelligence to enable our advertisers to add limited content to their ads.


**Legitimate interests relied on**
It is in our interest and in the interest of Pinterest users to receive relevant and interesting adverts for products or services they are interested in, as opposed to receiving randomized and generic ads which they may have no interest in. This is also the primary funding of the service and allows users to continue enjoying the service free-of-charge and allows Pinterest to generate revenue.

## To provide measurement and ad analytics we:
  * Use aggregated information from our measurement providers to tell our ad partners how their Pinterest ads are performing, and how to make them better. For example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed a Pin went on to visit that advertiser's site. To find out more about reporting on ads please visit the Help Center.


**Legitimate interests relied on**
It is in our interest to enable business accounts and advertisers to view and understand how their ads or content performed and the audience that viewed or interacted with their ads or content. This is so that they can make informed decisions (such as what kinds of ad campaigns they may want to run, the type of audience they want to reach and the types of content that users enjoy the most). This is also in the interest of other users as this helps keep the advertising and other content we show users relevant and entertaining, and keeps the Service free for all users.

We use info to comply with our legal obligations
## Why and how we use your info
**To comply with legal and regulatory obligations**
  * Accessing, storing, preserving, or sharing information when doing so in response to a court order, search warrant, production order, subpoena or similar legal request.
  * Accessing, storing, preserving, or sharing information when we think it is reasonably necessary to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including sharing with researchers, law enforcement, or other authorities.
  * To deal with and resolve requests and complaints. We retain correspondence relating to data subject requests under GDPR for two years, in case those requests are not resolved and this correspondence is required in order to handle any resulting complaints. In such cases, the correspondence is then retained while those complaints are being resolved.


**Examples of laws that can require us to process information in the above way include:**
  * Regulatory matters: to comply with regulatory obligations like under privacy laws (GDPR) and the Digital Services Act (DSA).
  * Civil, commercial, criminal, or consumer protection matters: where we are in receipt of a court order to disclose information for the purposes of court proceedings or regulatory inquiries (e.g. orders or mandatory requests under the Irish Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, GDPR).
  * Corporate and taxation matters: obligations such as the Irish Companies Act 2014 and the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.


**Issues relating to the safety of our Service and to protect rights, property and users**
  * We keep information where it is necessary to investigate misuse of our Services, such as spam and other bad experiences. If we disable an account for violating our Terms, we also preserve information about that user for safety, security and integrity purposes.


## Information categories used
Any of the categories of information listed in “We collect information in a few different ways” except for Precise location information (which we don’t collect from users in EEA, Switzerland, or the UK).
We use info where you give us consent
## How and why we use your info
Where you have given us consent (for example through your device settings):
  * Allowing searching with photos. For example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.
  * Ads on Pinterest based on offsite activities. We customize the ads we show you by identifying your interests based on your offsite activities, as well as by using information we receive from ad partners or other third parties. Where ad partners or other third parties share information with us about you, we rely on the consent they have already obtained.
  * Lead ads. If you submit information via a lead ad form (for example, to sign up for an advertiser’s mailing list or for a consultation), we will share that information with the advertiser as described on the form.
  * Promotion of Creators. If you choose to provide race or ethnicity information we will use it to promote you as a Creator, for example during Black History Month, or reach out to you about events.


## Information categories used
Any of the categories of information listed in “We collect information in a few different ways” except for Precise location information (which we don’t collect from users in EEA, Switzerland, or the UK).
Where we rely on consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time.
# Your Rights and Choices
We offer you certain choices to control your data. Depending on where you live (e.g., EEA, Switzerland, UK, U.S.), these choices may also be privacy rights you have under local law. To exercise these rights, please visit your account settings and, if you still need help, our Help Center.
  * **Access** : You can request access to the information we collect and hold about you in a portable format. You can find more information about this through our Help Center.
  * **Correction/rectification** : You can correct your information by updating information in your profile.
  * **Deletion/erasure** : You can have your information deleted. In your settings, select “Delete your data and account” and follow the instructions.
  * **Opt out of “targeted advertising” “sharing” or “sale”** : As explained above some of our activities may constitute “targeted advertising,” “sharing,” or “selling” as those terms are defined under certain state privacy laws in the U.S. You may opt out at any time by following the instructions in your Privacy and Data Settings menu. Note that you will still see ads on our Services, but they will not be informed by offsite data.


Where we rely on consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time.
Additional rights in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK
If you live in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, you also have some additional rights:
  * **Right to object or restrict processing** : You can object to direct marketing from us or where we rely on legitimate interests to process your information, such as where features supported by generative artificial intelligence are based on legitimate interests. You can object through this form.
  * **Right to withdraw consent** : Where we rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your data, you can withdraw your consent at any stage. The lawfulness of Pinterest’s processing before you withdraw your consent will not be affected by such withdrawal.
  * **Right to portability** : You can have the information you provided to us sent to another organization, where we hold this information with your consent or for the performance of a contract with you, and, where it's technically feasible for us to do so.
  * **Right to lodge a complaint** : If you reside in the EEA, Switzerland, and UK, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of your country.
    * In the UK, the relevant data protection authority is the Information Commissioner's Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire, SK9 5AF, +44 (0303) 123 1113, email: casework@ico.org.uk.
    * In Ireland, the relevant data protection authority is the Data Protection Commission, 21 Fitzwilliam Square South, Dublin 2, D02 RD28, +353 017650100 / + 353 1800437737, email: info@dataprotection.ie or by using the following online form: Forms for Data Protection.


For any of the privacy rights and choices referenced, you can also submit a request to our DPO regarding the use and disclosure of your information.
We will not discriminate against you if you choose to exercise your rights or options related to your personal information. These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, where they would infringe the rights of a third party (including our rights) or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interest to keep. If we deny your request to exercise your rights, you may have the right to appeal our decision by contacting us using privacy-support@pinterest.com.
You have choices regarding your information on Pinterest. If you have a Pinterest account, many of these controls are built directly into Pinterest or your settings. For example, you can: Edit information in your profile, Link or unlink your Pinterest account from other services (like Facebook or Google), Edit secret board settings, and Close your account at any time. We also support settings such as tracking settings on iOS and Android devices.
You may also have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Pinterest. For example:
  * The browser you use may let you control cookies or other types of local data storage.
  * Your mobile device lets you choose how and whether your precise location, photos, and other data is shared with us.


For users who reside in certain U.S. states and have enabled an opt-out preferences signal (such as Global Privacy Control), we will respect this preference when you use Pinterest.
# How and when we share information
Anyone can see the public content you post, such as boards and Pins you create and public profile information you give us. Depending on where you live, we also make this public information available through what are called APIs (a technical way to share information quickly). For example, a partner can study what their most popular Pins are or how their Pins are being shared on Pinterest by using a Pinterest API. We also share the categories of information described above:
  * With other services, at your direction. For example, when you decide to link your Pinterest account to third party services, or when you publish your content on Pinterest to such services, you direct disclosure of certain information to those services. Creators may direct us to share information with advertisers or other partners for paid engagements.
  * Depending on where you live, and your privacy settings, we share data for advertising and related purposes, including showing you ads about Pinterest on third-party services, enabling partners to show you ads both on and off Pinterest, and helping advertisers understand how ads on Pinterest perform. For example, when you fill out a lead ad form, or click on an ad on Pinterest, we’ll share information related to that action with advertising partners. We may also provide partners with information about you so that advertisers can show you ads on or off of Pinterest. Learn more about how we support third-party advertising and the settings you have to manage it here.
  * With vendors that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam. Some information we acquire may be collected by vendors on our behalf.
  * With law enforcement agencies, government agencies, researchers, or other parties in compliance with laws, rules, or regulations. For example, we may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts. We only disclose information in response to such requests if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Pinterest; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. We may also share information if we believe it is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person in emergency situations. To find out more about how we respond to law enforcement requests, please see our Law Enforcement Guidelines. We may share your publicly accessible information with independent researchers who meet certain criteria, to combat societal harms.
  * With our corporate family of companies, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Privacy Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser).


# Transferring your information
Pinterest is a worldwide service. By using our products or services, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal information in such countries may not be equivalent to those of your home country.
Additional steps for data transfers in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK
If you live in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we take additional steps related to data transfers. Information controlled by Pinterest Europe Limited will be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in, the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy. Safeguards which we rely on in ensuring your information benefits from an adequate level of protection includes the following:
  * Adequacy decisions. These are decisions issued from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “How we use the info we collect” to some countries with such adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed here; or
  * Data Privacy Frameworks. For transfers of personal data of EEA, Switzerland, and UK (and Gibraltar) residents to the U.S., Pinterest relies on and has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to: the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK (and Gibraltar) Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (UK Extension), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (together the Data Privacy Frameworks). Pinterest, Inc. complies with Data Privacy Frameworks. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/. The Data Privacy Frameworks are discussed in more detail below.
  * Standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”). The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for Switzerland and the UK) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “How we use the info we collect” to third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.


While transfers to countries that don’t have an adequacy decision typically take place on the basis of SCCs, in certain circumstances, transfers can also take place on the basis of exemptions provided under data protection law. For example, sharing with law enforcement, in emergency situations where we learn that a person’s life is at risk.
We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:
  * technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation; and
  * policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests.


For a copy of these adequacy decisions or SCCs, please contact us via the details provided in the Contact us section below.
#### More information on the Data Privacy Frameworks
In compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks, Pinterest, Inc. commits to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of your information. EU, UK and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our handling of personal data received in reliance on the Data Privacy Frameworks should first contact Pinterest Inc. at privacy-support@pinterest.com.
Pinterest, Inc. commits to refer unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the Data Privacy Frameworks to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Pinterest, Inc.’s compliance with the Data Privacy Frameworks. Under certain conditions, it may be possible to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding DPF compliance not resolved by any of the other DPF mechanisms, see here for additional information.
Pinterest, Inc. remains responsible if its agent, when acting on its behalf, processes personal information in a manner inconsistent with the DPF Principles, unless it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
# How long we keep your information
We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Pinterest to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't use it to identify you.
Additional information if you live in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK
We keep your information only so long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, which include providing our Service, or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, or protecting or defending our rights, property and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the following factors:
  * **The nature of the information and why it is collected and processed:** The length of time we will keep your information will generally be determined by how long we need that information to provide you with our Services, including any optional features you use and to provide customer support. For example:
    * We keep account information, like your name, email address, and password, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate your account.
    * We keep content such as information when you save or upload Pins, photos, or other content, interact with Pins or other content, for as long as it is necessary to process it for the purpose for which it was collected.
    * We keep your communications with us (for example, where you contact us for customer support or otherwise communicate with us) for a period of 2 years.
    * We generally keep log data for a period of 25 months to provide our Services to you, to make Pinterest safe, improve our product features, and to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting and personal to you.
  * **Legal and regulatory reasons:** In certain cases, we also keep your information for legal and regulatory reasons, including after your Pinterest account has been deleted. For example:
    * **For litigation or regulatory matters:** For example, we retain information for as long as we need it for a legal claim, litigation or regulatory proceeding.
    * **To handle and resolve requests and complaints:** We retain correspondence relating to data subject requests under GDPR for two years, in case those requests are not resolved and this correspondence is required in order to handle any resulting complaints. In such cases, the correspondence is then retained while those complaints are being resolved. When a user submits a complaint to Pinterest, Pinterest retains limited personal data of the complainant which includes their name, username, and user id associated with their email, plus the content of support tickets for two years.
    * **To respond to requests from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts:** For example, we retain/preserve your information for as long as is reasonably necessary where we receive a legal request for example a preservation order or search warrant related to your account.
