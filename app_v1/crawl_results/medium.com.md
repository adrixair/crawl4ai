# The N+1 Database Query Problem: A Simple Explanation and Solutions

If you work with databases and applications, you may have heard of the **N+1 problem**. It‚Äôs a common performance issue that happens when an application makes too many database queries instead of fetching data efficiently. This can slow down your app and make it harder to scale.
# What Is the N+1 Problem?
Imagine you have a list of students, and each student has multiple courses they are enrolled in. This is a one-to-many relationship because one student can have many courses.
Now, let‚Äôs say you need to get all students along with their courses. If your application is not optimized, it might do the following:
1. First, fetch all students:
```
SELECT * FROM students;
```

2. Then, for each student, fetch their courses one by one:
```
SELECT * FROM courses WHERE student_id = ?;
```

If you have 100 students, this results in 101 queries (1 query for students + 100 queries for courses). That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called the **N+1 problem** ‚Äî you run N (number of students) + 1 queries.

# **Part 1. The Era of SQL and Its Strengths**
Before we talk about why SQL stopped being the only choice, let‚Äôs discuss why it was the go-to tool in the first place ‚Äî and how it earned that spot.
## The Reign of Relational Databases
In the beginning, there was Oracle. And IBM DB2. And eventually MySQL and PostgreSQL. Relational databases were everywhere. Because they solved the problems developers had in the ‚Äô80s, ‚Äô90s, and early 2000s:
  * Storing structured data.
  * Making sure data relationships stayed consistent.
  * Performing complex queries ‚Äî and doing it all reliably.


Everything in SQL land was about structure. Tables with fixed schemas, relationships enforced by foreign keys, and guarantees that your data wasn‚Äôt going to end up in some weird half-saved state. That structure made things safe and predictable, and in business systems, that‚Äôs gold.
In fact, relational algebra (the math behind SQL) gave the whole model a solid theoretical foundation. It wasn‚Äôt just a bunch of hacks that happened to work. It was based on decades of database theory.
## ACID Transactions: The Gold Standard of Consistency
