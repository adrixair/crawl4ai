## CMA CGM BRAZIL: END-TO-END CUSTOMIZED SERVICES
  
  

Since the 80’s, the CMA CGM Group has called Brazilian ports and in 2003 launched its own maritime agency (CMA CGM do Brasil), expanding – therefore – its services.
CMA CGM do Brasil, currently, has more than 250 employees in Brazil, counting on 5 offices strategically located calling at 11 ports.
Besides the maritime transportation, CCBR offers intermodal connections via barge, rail, cabotage ships and trucks, a comprehensive logistics chain.
CMA CGM is capable to offer in Brazil customized solutions, including project cargo operations and is a leader in refrigerated cargoes mainly in the Northeast.
