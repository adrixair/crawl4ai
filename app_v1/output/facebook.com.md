## If you’re in the _European Region_, your ad choices are different. Learn more about your ad choices.
You must be logged into Facebook to access your Ad preferences.
To show you more relevant ads, we receive and use information that advertisers and other partners provide to us about your activity on their websites and apps, as well as some of your offline interactions, such as purchases. For example, we may show you an ad for a shirt based on your visit to a clothing website. 
You can choose whether we use this information to show you ads by adjusting your Activity information from ad partners setting in your **Ad preferences**. 
## Adjust what ads are shown to you based on your Activity information from ad partners #
  1. Click your profile picture in the top right of Facebook. 
  2. Select **Settings & privacy**, then click **Settings**. 
  3. Click **Accounts Center** , then click **Ad preferences**.
  4. Click the **Manage info** tab. 
  5. Click **Activity information from ad partners**.
  6. Click **Review setting**.
  7. Choose whether we can show you ads based on your activity information from ad partners.


**Note:** Not everyone will be able to access this setting in Accounts Center at this time.  If these steps don't work for you, try updating your app or go to accountscenter.facebook.com on your web browser. 
**Note:** You will only be asked to confirm your choice if you make a change to your Activity information from ad partners setting. 
##  Activity information from ad partners #
This setting controls whether we can show you relevant ads on Facebook based on information about your Activity information from ad partners. If you turn off this setting, the ads you see may still be based on your activity on our platform. They may also be based on information from a specific business that has shared a list of individuals or devices with us, if we've matched your profile to information on that list.
The choice you make in your Activity information from ad partners setting will apply to all of your accounts in the same Accounts Center. 
**Note:** You may have different ad experiences across your accounts if they aren’t added to the same Accounts Center. Learn more about settings you can manage across your accounts in Accounts Center.
We adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and participate in the opt-out programs established by the Digital Advertising Alliance, the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. You can opt out from all participating companies through these sites.

## Cookies Policy
What are cookies, and what does this policy cover?

Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers. Cookies are used to store and receive identifiers and other information on computers, phones and other devices. Other technologies, including data that we store on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other software, are used for similar purposes. In this policy, we refer to all of these technologies as “cookies”.
We use cookies if you have a Facebook or Instagram account, use the Meta Products, including our website and apps, or visit other websites and apps that use the Meta Products (including the Like button). Cookies enable Meta to offer the Meta Products to you and to understand the information that we receive about you, including information about your use of other websites and apps, whether or not you are registered or logged in.
This policy explains how we use cookies and the choices you have. Except as otherwise stated in this policy, the Privacy Policy will apply to our processing of the data that we collect via cookies.
Why do we use cookies?
Cookies help us provide, protect and improve the Meta Products, such as by personalising content, tailoring and measuring ads, and providing a safer experience. The cookies that we use include session cookies, which are deleted when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay in your browser until they expire or you delete them.

  * Websites and apps provided by other companies that use the Meta Products, including companies that incorporate Meta technologies into their websites and apps. Meta uses cookies and receives information when you visit those sites and apps, including device information and information about your activity, without any further action from you. This occurs whether or not you have a Facebook or Instagram account or are logged in.


Do other Companies use cookies in connection with the Meta Products?
Yes, other companies use cookies on the Meta Products to provide advertising, measurement, marketing and analytics services to us, and to provide certain features and improve our services for you.

## Privacy Policy
We updated our Privacy Policy on June 16, 2025. View our previous policy.
What is the Privacy Policy and what does it cover?
Effective June 16, 2025 | View printable version | See previous versions
Read the United States Regional Privacy Notice for more details about how we handle Personal Information and how to exercise your rights.
### 
Highlights
We at Meta want you to understand what information we collect, and how we use and share it. That’s why we encourage you to read our Privacy Policy. This helps you use Meta Products in the way that’s right for you.
In the Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect, use, share, retain and transfer information. We also let you know your rights. Each section of this Policy includes helpful examples and simpler language to make our practices easier to understand. We’ve also added links to resources where you can learn more about the privacy topics that interest you.
It's important to us that you know how to control your privacy, so we also show you where you can manage your information in the settings of the Meta Products you use. You can update these settings to shape your experience.
Read the full Policy below.
What Products does this Policy cover?
* * *
Learn more in Privacy Center about managing your privacy
What information do we collect?
### 
Highlights
The information we collect and process about you depends on how you use our Products. For example, we collect different information if you sell furniture on Marketplace than if you post a reel on Instagram. When you use our Products, we collect some information about you even if you don't have an account.
Here's the information we collect:
Your activity and information you provide
* * *
Friends, followers and other connections
* * *
App, browser and device information
* * *
Information from partners, vendors and other third parties
What if you don’t let us collect certain information?
Some information is required for our Products to work. Other information is optional, but without it, the quality of your experience might be affected.
Learn more
What if the information we collect doesn’t identify individuals?
In some cases information is de-identified, aggregated, or anonymized by third parties so that it no longer identifies individuals before it’s made available to us. We use this information as described below without trying to re-identify individuals.
Take control
Manage the information we collect about you
Privacy Center
How do we use your information?
### 
Highlights
We use information we collect to provide a personalized experience to you, including ads, along with the other purposes we explain in detail below.
For some of these purposes, we use information across our Products and across your devices. The information we use for these purposes is automatically processed by our systems. But in some cases, we also use manual review to access and review your information.
To use less information that’s connected to individual users, in some cases we de-identify or aggregate information or anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you. We use this information in the same ways we use your information as described in this section.
Here are the ways we use your information:
To provide, personalize and improve our Products
We use information we have to provide and improve our Products. This includes personalizing features, content and recommendations, such as your Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Stories and ads. We use information with special protections you choose to provide for these purposes, but not to show you ads.

To promote safety, security and integrity
