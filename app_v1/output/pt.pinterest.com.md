**Frequently asked questions** 


How do I use Pinterest for business? 

    
First, get a free business account. Then, check out our guide to getting started for tips about business tools and features. 


What is a business account? 

    
People use Pinterest to discover new brands and shop their products. With a business account, you’ll have more tools to help reach these audiences and grow your business. For example, you’ll gain access to ads, analytics and custom audience insights. Business accounts are free, and you can set your own budget if you decide to run ads. 


Should I have a separate Pinterest account for my business?

    
A business account gives you access to powerful tools like ads and analytics. These features aren’t available on a standard Pinterest account, so you’ll want to make sure you’re using a business account for any marketing goals. If you already have a personal account, you can convert it to a business account in a few simple steps. Or, you can sign up for a new account if you prefer to keep your personal and work accounts separate. 


What are the benefits of using Pinterest for my business? 

    
People come to Pinterest with an open mind. They’re excited to find new brands and products to shop. With a Pinterest business account, you can get in front of the audience you care about at any stage along this journey—then help guide them into purchasing.  


Is it easy to sell on Pinterest? 

    
Shopping features are designed into many parts of our platform. This means your products will fit right into people’s experience, instead of feeling out of place. You can learn more about shopping ads and products on our dedicated page.
