# Terms of Use
**Welcome to Waze!**
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your rights and obligations regarding the use of Waze’s Software (“Software”) and service (both collectively referred to as the “**Service** ”) on the Internet or in cellular media. These Terms constitute a fully binding agreement between Waze Mobile Ltd. (including its affiliates and subsidiaries, “Waze” or “We”) the proprietor of all rights in and to the Service, and you. It is therefore recommended that you carefully read these Terms.
By using the Waze Service, you signify your assent to these Terms;
  1. Waze’s privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”); and
  2. Waze’s copyright policy (“Copyright Policy”)


all of which are an integral part of these Terms.
If you do not agree to these Terms or any of its parts, then you are prohibited and must refrain from using the Service.
### KEY POINTS
The following key points of the Terms are highlighted here for your convenience only. These key points are not made in lieu of the full Terms and their presence in this section does not mean that they are intended to supersede or override any other terms or conditions provided by Waze..
  * **Road information prevails**. The information provided by the Service is not intended to replace the information provided on the road, such as travel direction, time based restrictions, lane restrictions, road blockades, traffic signs, traffic lights, police instructions, etc.
  * **Cautious driving**. Always drive vigilantly according to road conditions and in accordance with traffic laws. It is strictly forbidden to send traffic updates (such as updates on road accidents and traffic congestion), or to non-verbally interact with the Service or use the Service in a non-verbal manner for any purpose other than navigation while driving. Traffic updates or non-verbal reports you want to submit to the Service may only be sent after you have stopped your vehicle in an appropriate location permitted by law. Alternatively, such updates may be sent by a passenger other than the driver, provided it does not interfere with the due course of driving and does not distract the driver’s attention to the road.
  * **Non-continuous updates**. The information provided by the Service originates from other users of the Service. Such information is intrinsically fluctuant and may be inaccurate, incomplete or outdated. Waze does not provide any warranties to such information’s credibility or reliability.
  * **Location-based Service**. Some features of the Service make use of detailed location and route information, for example in the form of GPS signals and other information sent by your mobile device on which the Waze application is installed and activated. These features cannot be provided without utilizing this technology. Please note, as described in detail in the Privacy Policy:
    * Waze uses your location and route information to create a detailed route history of all of your journeys made when using the Service. Waze uses this history to offer the Service to you, to improve the quality of the Service it offers to you and to all of its users, to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data, and more as described in detail in the Privacy Policy. This history is associated with your account and username (if you have chosen to set up a username). This history is retained by Waze for a limited period of time and in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
    * Waze allows you to use the Service whether or not you choose to set up a username for yourself. If you choose to use the Service without setting up a username you may do so by skipping the username setup stage of the application installation process. Waze will still link all of your information with your account and a unique identifier generated by Waze in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Note that in order to access certain features of the Service (for example map editing, ranking, moods) you will need to set up a username.
  * **Advertisements**. Third party advertisements may appear on the Service from time to time. Waze does not endorse these advertisements, and the advertisements are not intended to be, nor should they be, viewed by drivers unless and until their vehicle has come to a complete stop.
  * **The Internet connection required to use the Service, and any associated charges (e.g. mobile data expenses) incurred by your use of the Service are your exclusive responsibility and made solely at your expense**. Transmitting and receiving real-time updates to and from the Service, requires an online (e.g. Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G) connection between your cellular device and the Internet. The expenses of such connection are as prescribed by the agreement between you and your communication service provider (such as your cellular company), and according to its applicable terms of payment.
  * **Free Software**. The Service utilizes Software for map displays, updates and road information. With respect to some cellular telephone devices running the Software, the Software is a free-software. In such cases you may redistribute the Software or modify it in accordance with the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, whether it is version 2.0 of the license or any later version of your choice.

# Waze Copyright Policy
Waze Mobile Ltd. ("**Waze** ") respects the intellectual property rights of others and requests the users of its services to do the same. If you believe that certain content, which appears on Waze real-time road maps (the "**Service** "), infringes upon copyrights that you own or represent, you may send Waze's designated copyright agent ("**Copyright Agent** ") a written notification, stating the location of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed, in accordance with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("**DMCA** ").
Upon your notification, Waze may remove or disable access to any such content.
To be effective, your notification of claimed infringement must be a written communication provided to the Copyright Agent that includes substantially the following:
  1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
  2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed via using the Website, or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
  3. Identification of the material that is claimed to infringe or to be the subject of infringing activity and that access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Waze to locate the material, including the exact URI (Uniform resource Identifier) or coordinates on the Service's maps in which you discovered the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed;
  4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit Waze to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;
  5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
  6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.


Following receipt of your communication, Waze may ask you to provide further or supplemental information, prior to removing any content which was displayed on the Website, as Waze deems necessary to comply with the provisions of the DMCA. Waze may also provide the registered user who uploaded the allegedly infringing content with your contact details, in order for that person to be able to contact you directly and communicate with you regarding your notification.
**Counter notification**
You may submit a counter notification to the Copyright Agent. To be effective, your counter notification must be a written communication provided to the Copyright Agent that includes substantially the following:
  1. Your physical or electronic signature;
  2. Identification of the material to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before access to it was disabled.
  3. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be disabled;
  4. Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which you may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.


After receipt of a counter notification, Waze will promptly provide the person who submitted the claimed copyright infringement notification with a copy of the counter notification, and will inform that person that Waze will replace the removed material, or cease disabling access to that material 10 business days.
Waze will then replace the removed the material and cease disabling access to it between 10 to 14 business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless the Copyright Agent first receives notice from the person who notified Waze of the claimed copyright infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the registered user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Waze's system or network.
**Repeat infringements**
Waze may deny or cancel any individual use of the Website, or terminate your user account, if Waze determines in its sole discretion that you are a repeat infringer. A repeat infringer is a user who has been notified of infringing activity more than once or a user that his or her uploaded material was removed from the Website more than once. Waze may decide, at its sole discretion that a sufficient reason exists for the immediate termination of your account for any reason, at any time. In these cases Waze may terminate your account immediately. Waze may notify you that it canceled your account by sending a message to the e-mail address that you provided during the registration process. Such notification will come into effect immediately.
**Copyright Agent Details**
The Copyright Agent is Tal Avery-Amit, Waze Mobile Ltd., Electra Tower, 29th Floor 98 Yigal Alon Tel-Aviv, 6789141 Israel Telephone: +972-74-746-6453  
Fax: +972-3-761-7171  
Email: copyright@waze.com.
Please note that the Copyright Agent receives DMCA notifications only. Any other matters, such as comments, requests and other messages should be referred to: support@waze.com
**Misrepresentations**
Under the provisions of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents: (1) that material is infringing, or (2) that material was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, that Waze may incur, if it is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of its reliance upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material claimed to be infringing.

# Sharing your information
### Personal information that you share
The Services are based on a community of users publicly sharing information with Waze and with other members of that community.
In particular, users may choose to share personal information such as name, age, gender, picture, their location information, reports and other files. This information may be shared either directly to the Services and to all users, such as in the case of traffic reports, or just to your friends on Waze. This information may also be shared via third party services (such as social networks) which interact with the Services upon such users’ choice. 
**You can decide whether or not to upload content to the Services. However any content that you choose to share and submit for posting is neither private nor confidential and you should expect that it may be made public and known to others.** Information you choose to upload will be posted along with your user name and other information including personal information you attached to your publicly available user profile. For example, your reports (map and road updates, traffic congestion updates, road accidents, etc.) will be posted on the Waze map along with your username. You should note that certain road incidents you report may include your driving path within the vicinity of those incidents. Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting information. At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information by means other than the Internet and cellular services.
In any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared from your social network accounts according to your privacy settings for such social network accounts), your email address will not be visible to others through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.
if you choose to either record your own voice onto the Service, or to use the voice command features, Waze will collect the voice information related to such use, including voice files. If, after recording your own voice, you chose to share your voice recordings, other Waze users and other people will be able to download and use your voice recordings. Once downloaded, Waze may not have any control over the voice files, so you should only share content that you are comfortable being made public.
We, at Waze, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you can have while using the Services. However, Waze has no control over the conduct of any user and disclaims all liability in this regard. Users are advised to carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public or available any information and carefully examine all necessary details related to any communication with other users prior to any engagement or communication being made.
Participating in any user’s activities as a result, directly or indirectly, from using Waze, is entirely at your own risk. Waze is not a party to any agreement entered into between the users in any circumstances. The user has the sole and ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all laws, regulations or any other duty. We do not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with your participation in any activity or event initiated, held or conducted by a user or a third party nor in connection to any agreement between the users or third parties, including any activity or event related in any way, directly or indirectly, the Services or the use thereof.
### When Waze shares your information
Waze does not sell, rent or lease your personal information to third parties.
Waze will not share your personal information with others, without your permission, except for the following purposes and to the extent necessary in Waze’s good-faith discretion:
  * As necessary for the facilitation and operation of the Services. For example, making public road incidents you report and which are associated with your username and your location;
  * If Waze reasonably believes that you have breached the Terms of Use or is investigating potential breach of the Terms of Use, or believes that you abused your rights to use the Services, or performed any act or omission that Waze reasonably believes to be violating any applicable law, rules, or regulations. Waze may share your information in these cases, with law enforcement agencies and other competent authorities and with any third party as may be required to handle any result of your wrongdoing;
  * If Waze is required, or reasonably believes that it is required by law to share or disclose your information;
  * In any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and Waze, or between you and other users with respect to, or in relation with the Services;
  * In any case where Waze reasonably believes that sharing information is necessary to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Waze, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law, including to prevent imminent physical damage or damage to property;
  * To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues;
  * If Waze organizes the operation of the Services within a different framework, or through another legal structure or entity, or if Waze is acquired by, or merged into or with another entity, or if Waze enters bankruptcy, provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by the provisions of this Privacy Policy, with respective changes taken into consideration;
  * To collect, store, hold and manage your personal information through cloud based or hosting services or a third party or a party affiliated or connected to Waze, as reasonable for business purposes, which may be located in the European Union and the U.S.A., potentially countries outside of your jurisdiction;
  * Waze may also share personal information with companies or organizations connected or affiliated with Waze, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies (i.e. entities that belong to the Google group of companies);
  * We work with other Google’s services (such as Google Display and Video 360) for advertising and ad measurement purposes. In order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Waze, Google, and websites & apps that partner with Google, we may share information with these services, such as a unique identifier for advertising (i.e, Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices or similar technologies). You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services and how you can control that in this page. For more information see section titled ‘Advertising campaigns’ under this Privacy Policy.
  * We also work with selected advertising and measurement services which help us understand how our users interact with ads served in our platform and in order to provide marketing, advertising and measurement services for Waze with respect to Waze’s own marketing efforts, by using and sharing devices’ identifiers (i.e, Advertising ID, cookies or similar technologies).
  * Personal information may also be shared with Waze’s trusted partners and service providers to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with customer services.


# Visibility
Please note that your username and some other information will be visible to others. Note that your username will be included along with any information you submit for posting (such as traffic reports or chat messages). It will therefore be visible to others. Also - your friends on Waze will see your name & profile photo and any other information you chose to share with them.
If you prefer to remain invisible on the Waze map, you can set the Waze Application not to show your location on the map. To do so you should go to the Privacy Settings and adjust accordingly by switching on to Invisible Mode. If on, **some features may not be available**. If you make this choice, while you will be ‘invisible’ on the map to other users, your location and route information will continue to be collected by Waze for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy.
# Integration with social networks
You may choose to share information between your Waze account and your social network account . Through this option, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from social networks, transmitted and shared through the Services. Similarly, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from Waze, including your location and route information, transmitted to and shared through your social network account.
By setting your Waze Account to integrate with social networks, including by signing onto Waze by using your social network account, you agree to share information (including personal information) between Waze and such social networks, for the purposes provided under this Privacy Policy.
The social network’s use of information made available by Waze is governed by that social network’s privacy policy and controlled by the social network, not by this Privacy Policy or Waze.
When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the first time or otherwise make the Services interact with your social network account, you will be asked by the social network to permit the social network to share your personal information stored on such social network with Waze. We collect your information from your social network account only in accordance with the permissions granted by you (such as your name, email address, list of friends, profile picture and other information available via the applicable social network).
You understand and agree that the Services may access, make available and store such information so that it is available on and through your Waze Account, until your Waze Account is deleted.
Please note that certain information which you have defined as private on your third party social network accounts may become public to other Waze Users through the Services once you have allowed the social network to share such information with Waze.
# Integration with other third party services
Waze may offer you the option to link Waze to third party services that may be useful to you (like, Spotify). Where Waze detects an integration may be available (either because a third party service attempts to link to Waze, or Waze detects an installed service on the device which has an integration option, or you request a particular integration), Waze will ask for confirmation to connect the accounts. If you choose to connect the accounts, Waze will ask for your permission to share data with the third party service. You should only agree to connect accounts if you are comfortable with the third party service receiving the data set out at the time of connecting the accounts and Waze is not responsible for the third party service’s use of data. You can disconnect Waze and the third party service at any time and Waze will cease sharing data with that service from the point of disconnection onwards.
# Controlling your personal information
You can always review and update certain information by visiting your Account & Login settings (such as your phone, name, photo and more) or the Waze destination list (to update your home, work and favorites). 
You can log on to the Waze website to view your route history by going to “Edit the Map”/ “Drives” function on the Waze website. Note that in order to access certain information you will need to register your Account. Your location and route history is associated with your Account.
If you find that the information associated with your Account is not accurate, complete or updated, then you should make all necessary changes to correct it. Please keep in mind that false, incorrect, or outdated information may prevent you from setting up an Account and impair the ability to provide you with Services.
### Privacy controls
Your in-app Privacy Settings provide you with quick access to settings and tools that let you safeguard your data and decide how your information can make Waze services work better for you. For example, you can control your visibility on the map and manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Waze. 
There are other ways to control the information Waze collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Waze Account, including device-level settings: your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your device.
### Deleting your information
If you would like us to delete your Account, please use the “Delete Account” function available under the in-app Privacy Setting and on the Waze website. On receiving such a request, Waze will use reasonable efforts to delete such information, however please note that information may not be deleted immediately from our back-up systems. We aim to initiate the deletion process immediately after your request. Once we receive your request, your data will no longer be used to personalize your Waze experience. We then begin a process designed to safely and completely delete the data from our storage systems. This process generally takes around 2 months from the time of deletion. As with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and time frames defined in this policy. We maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.
# How Waze retains data we collect
Some data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary. This section describes why we hold onto different types of data for different periods of time.
  * **Information retained until you remove it** - such as your “Home, “work”, favorites, email address and other account related information. We’ll keep this data in your Waze Account until you choose to remove it and/or update it.
  * **Data that expires after a specific period of time** - in some cases, you don’t need to actively delete your information as we set retention timeframes based on the reason for the data’s collection. For example, if you choose to connect your calendar to your Waze Account, we extract your calendar events for several days in advance and delete them after their occurrence. We may also take steps to anonymize certain data within set time periods.
  * **Information retained until your Waze Account is deleted** - we may keep some data for the life of your Waze Account if it’s useful for helping us understand how users interact with our features and how we can improve our services. For example, if you made an incident report, we will keep information about how many reports you have submitted, even after the event is removed. When you delete your Waze Account, the information about how many reports you have submitted is also removed.
  * **Information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes** - sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time. For example, when Waze processes a payment for you, we’ll retain this data for longer periods of time as required for tax or accounting purposes. Reasons we might retain some data for extended periods of time include: 
    * Security, fraud & abuse prevention
    * Financial record-keeping
    * Complying with legal or regulatory requirements
    * Ensuring the continuity of our services
    * Direct communications with Waze


# How does Waze use aggregated information?
Waze may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information (including anonymous location information), in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, to properly operate the Services, to improve the quality of the Services, to enhance your experience, to create new services and features, including customized services, to change or cancel existing content or service, and for further internal, commercial and statistical purposes (including advertising).
Waze may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on the Services, in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to users of the Services, to the Services’ providers, partners and any other third party. For example, GPS information that we receive from your mobile device may be provided to map editors in an aggregated and/or anonymous form to help improve the map and solve map problems, traffic data may be provided to cities, and aggregated ads analysis may be provided to advertisers.

Waze allows advertisers to run ad campaigns on the Services.
The information and advertisements that you see when accessing the Services may be targeted on the basis of your current Waze activity, such as your current location, your destination or contextual information based on your current drive session. For example: if you search for “gas station” you may see an ad for a local gas station.
Depending on your settings, you may also see **ads personalized** to you based on:
  * Information we received from you (for example, your saved “Home” & “Work” addresses)
  * Past activity and search query history (for example, drives that appear in your drive list)
  * Information from our ad partners, including entities that belong to the Google group of companies and other trusted ad partners.


You can decide whether we’ll show you personalized ads or not through your in-app **Privacy Settings– >Ads personalization**. Note: turning Ads personalization off does not turn off ads - only their personalization.
Please note:
  * We don’t knowingly collect nor do we show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
  * We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and share your phone number with the flower shop.
  * As described under “When Waze shares your information” section above, we work with other Google’s services (such as Google Doubleclick Bid Manager) for advertising and ad measurement purposes. In order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Waze, Google, and websites & apps that partner with Google, Waze may share information with these services such as a unique identifier for advertising (Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices or similar technologies). You can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services and how you can control that in this page.
  * The Ads personalization control described above apply to personalized ads served by Waze **on the Waze platform** and they do not apply to ads served on third parties platforms, including on Waze’s behalf.
  * When you visit a third party website from the Application, such third party may use cookies on your computer. The third party’s use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not to this Privacy Policy. If you wish to study the privacy policies of those third parties you should visit their services, or contact them directly.

If you have encountered any user generated advertising material, please inform us through the channels listed on the “About” menu in the Software or through the “Contact Us” page on the Site link here.
It is clarified that we are not responsible for the content of said advertisements and the products delivered or services rendered thereby by third parties and you irrevocably and unconditionally agree that we shall not be held responsible or liable for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result or in connection thereof.

Waze implements systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal information, to minimize the risk of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information. For example, we review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems. In addition, we restrict access to personal information to Waze employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.
However, these measures are unable to provide absolute assurance. Therefore, although Waze takes great efforts to protect your personal information, Waze cannot guarantee and you cannot reasonably expect that Waze’s databases will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.
# Compliance & cooperation with regulators
We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
### Data Transfers
We store data on servers located around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.
When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.
### European Requirements
If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the controls described in this policy so you can exercise your right to request access to, update, remove, delete, and restrict the processing of your information.
You can also export a copy of data in your Waze account if you want to back it up or export your information to another service. You can log in to the dashboard by going to the Waze website, then Settings, then choose Download your data archive. Note that in order to access the dashboard you will need a Waze account with a valid email address to receive your data archive.
You also have the right to object to the processing of your information.
We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:
_With your consent_
We ask for your agreement to process your information for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can manage your settings at any time, including your in-app Privacy Settings.
_When we’re pursuing legitimate interests_
We process your information for our legitimate interests and those of third parties (such as partners including advertisers, in order to report use statistics) while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This means that we process your information for things like:
  * Providing, maintaining, and improving our services to meet the needs of our users
  * Developing new services and features that are useful for our users
  * Understanding how people use our services (including how they interact with our ads) to ensure and improve the performance of our services
  * Customizing our services to provide you with a better user experience
  * Marketing to inform users about our services
  * Providing advertising, which keeps many of our services free
  * Detecting, preventing, or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our services
  * Protecting against harm to the rights, property or safety of Waze, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law, including disclosing information to government authorities
  * Performing research that improves our services for our users and benefits the public
  * Fulfilling obligations to our partners like developers and rights holders
  * Enforcing legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of applicable Terms of Service


_When we’re providing a service_
We process your data to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract (including our terms of use).
_When we’re complying with legal obligations_
We’ll process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so, for example, if we’re responding to legal process or an enforceable governmental request.
If you have questions, you can contact Waze and our data protection office at: privacy@waze.com. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under local law.
### Brazilian Requirements
If Brazilian data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the controls described in this policy so you can exercise your right to:
  * Obtain confirmation on whether we process your information
  * Request access to, update, review, anonymise, and remove your information
  * Object to or restrict the processing of your information
  * Export your information to another service


We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:
_With your consent_
Where we ask for your consent to process your information for specific purposes, you do not have to provide your consent but where you choose to do so, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can manage your settings at any time, including your in-app Privacy Settings. You also have the right to obtain information about the effects of not providing your consent to processing for specific purposes.
_When we’re pursuing legitimate interests_
We process your information for our legitimate interests and those of third parties (such as partners including advertisers, in order to report use statistics) while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy. This means that we process your information for things like:
  * Providing, maintaining, and improving our services to meet the needs of our users
  * Developing new services and features that are useful for our users
  * Understanding how people use our services (including how they interact with our ads) to ensure and improve the performance of our services
  * Customizing our services to provide you with a better user experience
  * Marketing to inform users about our services
  * Providing advertising, which keeps many of our services free

  * Enforcing legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of applicable Terms of Service


_When we’re providing a service_
We process your data to provide a service you’ve asked for under a contract (including our terms of use).
_When we’re complying with legal obligations_
We’ll process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so, for example, if we’re responding to legal process or an enforceable governmental request. If you have questions, you can contact Waze and our data protection office at: privacy@waze.com. And you can contact your local data protection authority if you have concerns regarding your rights under Brazilian law.
### U.S. State Law requirements
Some U.S. state privacy laws require specific disclosures.
These laws include:
  * California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA);
  * Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA);
  * Colorado Privacy Act (CPA);
  * Connecticut Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring (CTDPA); and
  * Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)


This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Waze handles your information:
  * We explain the categories of information Waze collects and the sources of that information in Information That is Being Collected.
  * We explain how Waze uses information in Why Waze Collects Data.
  * We explain when Waze may disclose information in Sharing Your Information. Waze does not sell your personal information. Waze also does not “share” your personal information as that term is defined in the CCPA.
  * We explain how Waze retains information in How Waze Retains Data We Collect. You can also learn more about How does Waze Use Aggregated Information. When Waze anonymizes data to protect your privacy, we maintain policies and technical measures to avoid re-identifying that information.


U.S. state privacy laws also provide the right to request information about how Waze collects, uses, and discloses your information. And they give you the right to access your information, sometimes in portable format, correct your information, and request that Waze delete that information. Many of these laws also provide the right to opt out of certain forms of profiling and targeted advertising. They also provide the right to not be discriminated against for exercising these privacy rights.
We describe the choices you have to manage your privacy and data in Controlling your personal information section. These controls allow you to access, review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it. You can also turn off personalized ads, by visiting your in-app ad settings. You can log in to the dashboard by going to the Waze website, then Settings, then choose Download your data archive. Note that in order to access the dashboard you will need a Waze account with a valid email address to receive your data archive. When you use these tools, we’ll validate your request by verifying that you’re logged in to your Waze Account. If you have questions or requests related to your rights under U.S. state privacy laws, you (or your authorized agent) can also contact Waze at privacy@waze.com. And if you disagree with the decision on your request, you can ask Waze to reconsider it by responding to the support team’s email. 
Some U.S. state privacy laws require a description of data practices using specific categories. This table uses these categories to organize the information in this Privacy Policy.
# Changes to this Privacy Policy
Waze may from time to time change the terms of this Privacy Policy. Substantial changes will take effect 30 days after Waze has posted a:
  * System message to users notifying them of changes to the Privacy Policy; and
  * Notification on the Website’s homepage or any other relevant web pages, explaining the changes to the Privacy Policy alongside a comparison of the “old” and “new” versions of the Privacy Policy.


Other changes will take effect 7 days after their initial posting on the Website. However, if Waze amends this Privacy Policy to comply with legal requirements, the amendments will become effective immediately upon their initial posting, or as required.
You agree to be bound by any of the changes made in the terms of this Privacy Policy. Continuing to use the Services will indicate your acceptance of the amended terms. If you do not agree with any of the amended terms, you must avoid any further use of the Services.

# Waze Cookie Policy
This policy explains how Waze Mobile Limited and its affiliates (“Waze”) uses cookies and your related choices. For more information on other ways we collect and use information from you and your use of our services, please see our Privacy Policy. In this policy we use the term “cookies” to refer to any applicable tracking technologies described herein.
## WHAT ARE COOKIES?
  * **A cookie** is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.
  * **A pixel tag** is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
  * **Single Sign-on** allows you to sign in to certain of websites or mobile applications using sign-in services provided by third parties, such as Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.


## HOW WE USE COOKIES?
**Below you can see a list of the types of cookies used by Waze.**
### Processes
Process cookies help the website to work and deliver services that the website visitor expects, like navigating around web pages or accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, the website cannot function properly.
### Preferences
These cookies allow our websites to remember information that changes the way the site behaves or looks, such as the region you are in. For instance, by remembering your region, a website may be able to provide you with relevant language preferences. These cookies can also assist you in changing text size, font, and other parts of web pages that you can personalize.
Loss of the information stored in a preference cookie may make the website experience less functional but should not prevent it from working.
### Authentication
We use these cookies to help us show you the right information and settings when you are signed in to our website.
### Security
We use security cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of Sign in credentials, and protect user data from unauthorized parties.
### Session State
Websites often collect information about how users interact with a website. This may include the pages users visit most often and whether users get error messages from certain pages. We use these so-called ‘session state cookies’ to help us improve our services, in order to improve our users’ browsing experience. Blocking or deleting these cookies will not render the website unusable.
### Analytics
Google Analytics is Google’s analytics tool that helps website and app owners to understand how their visitors engage with their properties. It may use a set of cookies to collect information and report website usage statistics without personally identifying individual visitors to Google. The main cookie used by Google Analytics is the ‘__ga’ cookie.
## YOUR CHOICES
  * Please note that some cookies, such as Processes cookies, are essential to operate our website and without these cookies, the website cannot function properly.
  * Some browsers limit or delete cookies, so you may want to review your cookie settings and ads settings. In some browsers you can set up rules to manage cookies on a site-by-site basis, giving you more fine-grained control over your privacy. This means that you can disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust.
  * If you use Google Chrome browser, you can use the “Clear Browsing Data” option included in Tools menu to delete cookies and other site and plug-in data, including data stored on your device by the Adobe Flash Player (commonly known as Flash cookies). See instructions for managing cookies in Chrome.
  * Another feature of Chrome is its incognito mode. You can browse in incognito mode when you don’t want your website visits or downloads to be recorded in your browsing and download histories. Any cookies created while in incognito mode are deleted after you close all incognito windows.
  * You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online advertising via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programmes in many countries, such as the US-based aboutads.info choices page or the EU-based Your Online Choices.
  * Finally, you can manage cookies in your web browser.


## CHANGES TO THIS COOKIE POLICY
We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. We encourage you to periodically review this Cookie Policy to stay informed about our use of cookies, the information we collect via cookies, and any updates in relation thereto. If we make any changes to this Cookie Policy that significantly impact the way we use cookies, we will endeavor to provide you with notice in advance of such change on our website. Your continued use of our website constitutes your agreement to this Cookie Policy and any updates.
## CONTACT US
If you have any questions about our use of cookies, please contact us at privacy@waze.com.

# Waze Community Terms of Service
**Welcome to the Waze community!**
Waze's mission is to work together to improve the quality of everyone's daily driving. By taking part in the Waze community, you help other Wazers get a more accurate map, up to date traffic reports, localized app and features, and more. These Community Terms govern your rights and obligations regarding the use of Waze’s Software (“Software”) and service (both collectively referred to as the “Service”), and are in addition to, and are not intended to replace the Waze _Terms of Service_, which are hereby incorporated by reference. In the event of a conflict between the Community Terms and the Waze Terms of Service, the Waze _Terms of Service_ shall prevail.
### DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS
Waze is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive community. We aim to create a community that celebrates the diversity of our community members, partners and drivers. We endeavor to build features that work for everyone by including perspectives from backgrounds that vary by race, ethnicity, social background, religion, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, veteran status and national origin.
We are committed to a supportive environment, where community members have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential. We are striving to grow and preserve a community culture of mutual respect, transparency and acceptance where all voices may be heard. Community members are expected to do their utmost to create a space and culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination.
Waze prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying of any form. Therefore, we would like to ask for your cooperation to address others with respect and to be mindful of the effect your words and/or behavior might have on others. This is not limited to our virtual interaction channels (Waze official and non official channels) but also applies to the instances when we meet face to face. 
If you believe you’ve been bullied or harassed by anyone, we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident by emailing us at _product@waze.com_. We will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take necessary action, including, but not limited to, banning the relevant users from some or all of Waze’s channels.
### PROHIBITED COMMUNICATION
Our community members shall never do the following (including in external links):
  * Flame, insult, or threaten other members (even as a joke)
  * Post or share personal information about others (i.e. name, address, email, phone number, etc.)
  * Publicly post or share private discussions with other users or staff (unless the sender has given you permission to do so). Private discussions are intended to be just that - private.
  * Post copyrighted material
  * Post or link to violent or sexually explicit content
  * Post or link to hate speech (including slandering or vilifying a particular race, religion, ethnic group, gender, sexual preference, or sexual identity)
  * Post or link to content that facilitates or encourages dangerous activities or that can in any way cause serious physical harm to individuals, animals or the environment
  * Post false, inaccurate, or deceptive information can cause significant harm to individuals or businesses
  * Post or link to content produced by or on behalf of terrorist groups or to content that incites violence, promotes terrorist acts or celebrates terrorist attacks
  * Post or link to content that exploits, abuses, or that may endanger minors 
  * Post religious, political, and other “prone to huge arguments” posts or comments
  * Post links to phishing sites or spam
  * Solicit, beg, auction, sell, or advertise any product or service, or refer to third parties who do so
  * Promote or link to exploits, cheating programs, or any other sort of illegal activity
  * Impersonate a Waze employee


Please note that Waze is not moderating the content in the community internal chats. However, all the Waze communication guidelines apply to those chats as well. Chat admins may block or remove any community members that disrespect these guidelines. 
We take the actions above seriously, and performing such prohibited actions may result in immediate, temporary, or permanent suspension of posting privileges (even without prior notification). Serious or sustained offenses can also result in the suspension of the user's access to the forum and/or blocking of the user’s Waze account.
### CONFIDENTIALITY
As a member of the Waze community, you may be exposed to Waze’s confidential information such as information related to new features we are working on and/or partnerships that have not been announced to the public yet. You are expected to keep any information that Waze shares with you as confidential and not share it with third parties outside of the Waze community. 
### BETA TESTERS COMMUNITY
As a member of the Waze Beta Community, you will be asked to use and provide your feedback on new features that we are working on. Waze conducts thorough testing and quality assurance before releasing any feature to be tested by our beta community to ensure that such features conforms with our product and safety standards. Nevertheless, some flows may be incomplete, broken etc. Please make sure to always drive vigilantly according to road conditions and in accordance with traffic laws. It is strictly forbidden to send feedback about beta features, or to non-verbally interact with the Service or use the Service in a non-verbal manner for any purpose other than navigation while driving. Feedback about beta features or non-verbal reports you want to submit to the Service may only be sent after you have stopped your vehicle in an appropriate location permitted by law. Alternatively, such updates may be sent by a passenger other than the driver, provided it does not interfere with the due course of driving and does not distract the driver’s attention to the road.
### WAZE MAP EDITORS COMMUNITY
When making edits to the Waze map, some of your information may be public, for example: any edits you make in the app can be public; your Username may be used to identify you in the forum and other community related tools, and in public summaries of the community activity (such as the Map Raids “hall of fame” board and other leaderboards); your Username and any edits you make can also be used for moderation actions that the community is responsible for. 
When editing the map, you must comply with the editing guidelines established by the local community you are a part of. When you submit map edits, or any other content to be published on the Service (“Content”), you represent and warrant that you have the necessary legal rights to post the Content publicly on the Service in accordance with the Waze _Terms of Service_. 
We encourage new community members to be in contact with local community leaders who can provide guidance and assistance on editing the Waze map. You can contact your local community leaders via the Waze _Forum_ or Waze Chat.
### LOCALIZATION COMMUNITY
Localization is the process of adapting a product or service to a specific locale, such as a country or region. This can involve translating the product or service into the local language, as well as adapting the content and design to meet the local culture and customs. 
When Localizing a language you must comply with the original text and Waze glossary.
### SURVEYS AND EVENTS
When you join the Waze community, you acknowledge and agree that Waze may contact you from time to time in connection with your Waze activity. For example, we may contact you and ask you to answer surveys related to your role and the community you are a member of. Participation in our surveys is completely voluntary and you may opt out of being contacted at any time via the notification settings in your Waze mobile app or by emailing us to Communities-Surveys@google.com. We may also contact you in connection with any events we are holding for our community members, and for community moderation purposes. 
### NO EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP
These Terms and your use of the Service, including the submission of content onto the Service, your participation as a member of the Waze community, and any other active or passive contribution you make to the Service, is completely voluntary and do not, and shall not be construed as creating any employment or business relationship, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency, or franchisor-franchisee relationship in any way and of any kind between the parties hereto. Your use of the Service is intended for your enjoyment and benefit and the provision of the Service to you and others, and (subject to your compliance with these Terms and with the Waze _Terms of Service_) constitutes the sole and sufficient consideration that you are entitled to receive for any Content or other contributions you have made to the Waze Service, its contents, maps and any other data.
### SHARING INFORMATION WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS
The Waze community is a self-moderating community, and so your username and activity in the community (such as the edits you have made in the map) may be shared with higher level community members for moderation purposes. Aggregated metrics may also be shared publicly in the community leader boards like the community “hall of fame”. If you choose to answer one of our surveys, aggregated survey results that do not personally identify you may also be shared with community leaders. 
### FEEDBACK 
In the course of your participation as a member of the Waze community, you may provide comments, feedback, ideas, reports, suggestions, data, or other information to Google relating to Waze and/or other Google products and services (collectively “Feedback”). Google may use any Feedback without restriction to develop and improve Google’s current or future products and services. You agree that you will not disclose to Google any third-party information in your Feedback that you are otherwise obligated to maintain as confidential. Google has no obligation to use your Feedback. Feedback collected is processed according to the _Waze Privacy Policy_.
### CONTACT US
You may contact us concerning any question about the Waze community by emailing us to _product@waze.com_. We will make our best efforts to address your inquiry promptly.

# Terms of Use
### Welcome to Waze!
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your rights and obligations regarding the use of Waze’s Software (“Software”) and service (both collectively referred to as the “**Service** ”) on the Internet or in cellular media. These Terms constitute a fully binding agreement between Waze Mobile Ltd. (including its affiliates and subsidiaries, “Waze” or “We”) the proprietor of all rights in and to the Service, and you. It is therefore recommended that you carefully read these Terms.
By using the Waze Service, you signify your assent to these Terms;
  1. Waze’s privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”); and
  2. Waze’s copyright policy (“Copyright Policy”)


all of which are an integral part of these Terms.
If you do not agree to these Terms or any of its parts, then you are prohibited and must refrain from using the Service.
### KEY POINTS
The following key points of the Terms are highlighted here for your convenience only. These key points are not made in lieu of the full Terms and their presence in this section does not mean that they are intended to supersede or override any other terms or conditions provided by Waze..
  * **Road information prevails**. The information provided by the Service is not intended to replace the information provided on the road, such as travel direction, time based restrictions, lane restrictions, road blockades, traffic signs, traffic lights, police instructions, etc.
  * **Cautious driving**. Always drive vigilantly according to road conditions and in accordance with traffic laws. It is strictly forbidden to send traffic updates (such as updates on road accidents and traffic congestion), or to non-verbally interact with the Service or use the Service in a non-verbal manner for any purpose other than navigation while driving. Traffic updates or non-verbal reports you want to submit to the Service may only be sent after you have stopped your vehicle in an appropriate location permitted by law. Alternatively, such updates may be sent by a passenger other than the driver, provided it does not interfere with the due course of driving and does not distract the driver’s attention to the road.
  * **Non-continuous updates**. The information provided by the Service originates from other users of the Service. Such information is intrinsically fluctuant and may be inaccurate, incomplete or outdated. Waze does not provide any warranties to such information’s credibility or reliability.
  * **Location-based Service**. Some features of the Service make use of detailed location and route information, for example in the form of GPS signals and other information sent by your mobile device on which the Waze application is installed and activated. These features cannot be provided without utilizing this technology. Please note, as described in detail in the Privacy Policy:
    * Waze uses your location and route information to create a detailed route history of all of your journeys made when using the Service. Waze uses this history to offer the Service to you, to improve the quality of the Service it offers to you and to all of its users, to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data, and more as described in detail in the Privacy Policy. This history is associated with your account and username (if you have chosen to set up a username). This history is retained by Waze for a limited period of time and in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
    * Waze allows you to use the Service whether or not you choose to set up a username for yourself. If you choose to use the Service without setting up a username you may do so by skipping the username setup stage of the application installation process. Waze will still link all of your information with your account and a unique identifier generated by Waze in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Note that in order to access certain features of the Service (for example map editing, ranking, moods) you will need to set up a username.
  * **Advertisements**. Third party advertisements may appear on the Service from time to time. Waze does not endorse these advertisements, and the advertisements are not intended to be, nor should they be, viewed by drivers unless and until their vehicle has come to a complete stop.
  * **The Internet connection required to use the Service, and any associated charges (e.g. mobile data expenses) incurred by your use of the Service are your exclusive responsibility and made solely at your expense**. Transmitting and receiving real-time updates to and from the Service, requires an online (e.g. Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G) connection between your cellular device and the Internet. The expenses of such connection are as prescribed by the agreement between you and your communication service provider (such as your cellular company), and according to its applicable terms of payment.
  * **Free Software**. The Service utilizes Software for map displays, updates and road information. With respect to some cellular telephone devices running the Software, the Software is a free-software.

If you are under 16, you may not download or use the Service. Accounts of users under the age of 16 years will be canceled and deleted by Waze, upon receiving notice.

# Google Terms of Service
Effective May 22, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDF
Country version: Brazil
## What’s covered in these terms
### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.
These Terms of Service reflect the way Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:
  * What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services
  * What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services
  * Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
  * In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms


Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.
Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.
# Terms
## Service provider
Google services are provided by, and you’re contracting with:
Google LLC  
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA  
  
1600 Amphitheatre Parkway  
Mountain View, California 94043  
USA
## Age requirements
If you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.
If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.
Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.

About these terms
# Your relationship with Google
These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its affiliates. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s business works and how we earn money.
## What you can expect from us
### Provide a broad range of useful services
We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:
  * apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
  * platforms (like Google Shopping)
  * integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
  * devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)


Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.
Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.
### Develop, improve, and update Google services
We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.
If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to applicable law and policies.
## What we expect from you
### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms
The permission we give you to access and use our services continues as long as you comply with:
  * **these terms**
  * **service-specific additional terms** , which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements


We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, Transparency Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site. Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.
Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.
### Respect others
We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:
  * comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
  * respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
  * don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others


Our service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy, provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the _Taking action in case of problems_ section.
### Don’t abuse our services
Most people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:
You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:
  * introducing malware
  * spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures
  * jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our safety and bug testing programs
  * accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:
    * phishing
    * creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews
    * misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human
    * providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us
  * providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not
  * using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights
  * reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law
  * using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)
  * using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology
  * hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms
  * providing services that encourage others to violate these terms


### Permission to use your content
Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.
## License
Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.
We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.
### What’s covered
This license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.
### What’s not covered
  * This license doesn’t affect your privacy rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
  * This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
    * publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
    * feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the _Service-related communications_ section below.


### Scope
This license is:
  * worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
  * non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
  * royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license


### Rights
This license allows Google to:
  * host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
  * publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
  * modify and create derivative works based on your content, such as reformatting or translating it
  * sublicense these rights to:
    * other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
    * our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the _Purpose_ section below


### Purpose
This license is for the limited purpose of:
  * **operating and improving the services** , which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
    * for spam, malware, and illegal content
    * to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
    * to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in Ads Settings)
This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
  * **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
  * **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms


### Duration
This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.
If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:
  * If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
  * If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.


# Using Google services
## Your Google Account
If you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.
You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.
## Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business
Many organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our services. To use our services on behalf of an organization:
  * an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
  * your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.


## Service-related communications
To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s Privacy Policy.
If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.
# Content in Google services
## Your content
Some of our services allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.
Some of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.
  * See the _Permission to use your content_ section for more about your rights in your content, and how your content is used in our services
  * See the _Removing your content_ section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services


If you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.
## Google content
Some of our services include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.
## Other content
Finally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.
# Software in Google services
Some of our services include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.
The license we give you is:
  * worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
  * non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
  * royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
  * personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
  * non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else


Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.
You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.
# In case of problems or disagreements
Both the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.
## Warranty
We provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.
## Disclaimers
The only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are provided in (1) the _Warranty_ section; (2) the service-specific additional terms; and (3) laws that can’t be limited by these terms.
**Don’t rely on the services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional.**
## Liabilities
### For all users
Both the law and these terms try to strike a balance as to what you or Google can claim from the other in case of problems. That’s why the law requires everyone to be responsible for certain liabilities — but not others — under these terms.
These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. These terms don’t limit liability for:
  * fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation
  * death or personal injury caused by negligence
  * gross negligence
  * willful misconduct


Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable service-specific additional terms, subject to applicable law.
### For business users and organizations only
If you’re a business user or organization:
  * To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.
  * If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
  * Google won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:
    * loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
    * indirect or consequential loss
    * punitive damages
  * Except as stated in the _For all users_ section above, Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.


## Taking action in case of problems
Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:
  * cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google
  * violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
  * compromise an investigation
  * compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services


### Removing your content
If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s intellectual property rights.
### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services
Without limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:
  * you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies
  * we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
  * we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you


For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this Help Center page. If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.
Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.
## Handling requests for your data
Respect for the privacy and security of your data underpins our approach to responding to data disclosure requests. When we receive data disclosure requests, our team reviews them to make sure they satisfy legal requirements and Google’s data disclosure policies. Google LLC accesses and discloses data, including communications, in accordance with the laws of Brazil or the United States. For more information about the data disclosure requests that Google receives worldwide, and how we respond to such requests, see our Transparency Report and Privacy Policy.
## Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
For information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.
California law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Google consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a California court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying California law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.
# About these terms
By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.
These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.
We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.
If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.
If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.
We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.
If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.
