# Plaenge expande para S√£o Paulo com foco no alto padr√£o
  * 

Grupo Plaenge 
###  Grupo Plaenge 
####  A maior construtora do Sul do pa√≠s 
Published Aug 7, 2023 
+ Follow 
O objetivo √© ‚Äúser uma marca relevante‚Äù na cidade em at√© 10 anos, com crescimento paulatino, afirma Alexandre Fabian, s√≥cio-diretor da incorporadora.
De janeiro a julho deste ano, a incorporadora Plaenge somou R$ 1,48 bilh√£o em vendas l√≠quidas, 74% mais do que no mesmo per√≠odo do ano passado, e R$ 1,43 bilh√£o em lan√ßamentos, incremento de 51%.
A companhia de capital fechado nasceu no Paran√° para fazer obras industriais, mas desde meados dos anos 1980 j√° tem no residencial o seu foco de atua√ß√£o. Hoje, apenas 5% da receita da companhia v√™m das obras para terceiros.
A empresa constr√≥i nas regi√µes Sul, Centro-Oeste e em Campinas (SP). Neste m√™s, faz seu primeiro lan√ßamento na capital paulista, em Moema.
Em S√£o Paulo, o empreendimento ter√° uma caracter√≠stica comum aos projetos paulistanos, a mistura de est√∫dios e unidades grandes, mas com entradas e √°reas de lazer separadas. No edif√≠cio Altier, as entradas para os apartamentos de 25 metros quadrados e para as unidades de 152 a 158 metros quadrados ficar√£o em ruas diferentes. ‚ÄúEm um apartamento desse, que vai ser normalmente para uma fam√≠lia, √© complicado misturar com est√∫dios, que t√™m publico circulante‚Äù, afirma Alexandre Fabian, s√≥cio-diretor da incorporadora.
O valor geral de venda (VGV) total do empreendimento √© de R$ 200 milh√µes, e as unidades ser√£o vendidas a partir de R$ 27 mil o metro quadrado, segundo a companhia.
O Superintendente Regional da empresa,  Fernando Motta  , destaca que os apartamentos ser√£o entregues com acabamento, piso, lou√ßas e metais sanit√°rios, que podem ser escolhidos pelo comprador por meio de um sistema de personaliza√ß√£o. H√° materiais b√°sicos que j√° est√£o inclu√≠dos no valor do metro quadrado. ‚ÄúSe quiser o mais sofisticado, paga a diferen√ßa‚Äù, afirma Fabian.
Segundo o s√≥cio-diretor, esse sistema n√£o gera receita significativa, mas foi criado para facilitar a mudan√ßa dos compradores, que n√£o precisariam reformar a unidade depois da entrega. O mesmo serve para os est√∫dios. ‚ÄúSe quiser colocar para alugar, est√° pronto‚Äù, afirma Motta.
A Plaenge quer vender essas unidades menores para investidores pessoa f√≠sica e est√° as oferecendo a clientes de outras cidades e Estados.
A companhia quer se posicionar no alto e alt√≠ssimo padr√£o paulistano. Al√©m das op√ß√µes de personaliza√ß√£o e das unidades grandes, Motta afirma que h√° toques mais comuns em empreendimentos de luxo, como tubula√ß√£o envelopada, para reduzir atritos, p√©-direito duplo e esquadrias do piso ao teto nos quartos.
Fabian afirma que o objetivo √© ‚Äúser uma marca relevante‚Äù na cidade em at√© 10 anos, com crescimento paulatino. Para 2024, prev√™ mais um lan√ßamento, de R$ 450 milh√µes em VGV, na rua Dr. Melo Alves, nos Jardins.
A empresa tamb√©m est√° fechando a compra de um terceiro terreno, na Vila Madalena, e busca √°reas em outras regi√µes consideradas nobres da cidade.
S√£o Paulo √© a nona cidade do pa√≠s em que a companhia vai construir ‚Äî tamb√©m trabalha no Chile. Nos pr√≥ximos cinco anos, afirma Fabian, n√£o deve haver novas expans√µes geogr√°ficas. ‚ÄúO plano √© nos consolidar nas cidades em que entramos‚Äù, diz. Antes de S√£o Paulo, a Plaenge estreou em Porto Alegre (RS).
A companhia foi surpreendida neste ano por um mercado com condi√ß√µes melhores do que esperava. Por causa das cidades em que atua, como Campo Grande (MS), Cuiab√° (MT) e Londrina (PR), terem grande peso do agroneg√≥cio e mais afinidade com o governo de Jair Bolsonaro, houve uma "onda de pessimismo" com a vit√≥ria de Lula (PT) nas elei√ß√µes, afirma Fabian. Esse pessimismo, no entanto, n√£o se transformou em redu√ß√£o do mercado, "Esper√°vamos um ano mais dif√≠cil", diz.
A dificuldade no momento n√£o est√° em conseguir vender, mas em encontrar m√£o de obra, que tamb√©m subiu de pre√ßo, segundo o s√≥cio-diretor. A falta de profissionais est√° principalmente em servi√ßos especializados, como assentadores de portas e azulejos. ‚ÄúPode querer pagar o dobro, n√£o tem‚Äù, afirma.
Para tentar minimizar o problema, a Plaenge tem investido em treinamento e forma√ß√£o de profissionais.

  1. ## Introduction
### 1.1 Contract
By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (‚ÄúContract‚Äù or ‚ÄúUser Agreement‚Äù), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.  

#### Services
This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (‚ÄúServices‚Äù), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the ‚ÄúApply with LinkedIn‚Äù and ‚ÄúShare with LinkedIn‚Äù plugins.
#### LinkedIn
You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù).
We use the term ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
If you reside in the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (‚ÄúLinkedIn Ireland‚Äù) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
If you reside outside of the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (‚ÄúLinkedIn Corp.‚Äù) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in our Privacy Policy, and updates. You acknowledge and have read our Privacy Policy.
### 1.2 Members and Visitors  

When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a ‚ÄúMember‚Äù. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a ‚ÄúVisitor.‚Äù
### 1.3 Changes
  

  

We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
  2. ## 2. Obligations
### 2.1 Service Eligibility
The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
‚ÄúMinimum Age‚Äù means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More
### 2.2 Your Account
Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don‚Äôts (below), and our Professional Community Policies. Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.  

### 2.3 Payment
If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
     * Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).
     * We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more
     * If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services.
     * We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.
     * All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn‚Äôs refund policy.
     * We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.  

You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under ‚ÄúPurchase History‚Äù.  

### 2.4 Notices and Messages
You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.  

Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us.
### 2.5 Sharing
Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.  

To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.
  3. ## 3. Rights and Limits
### 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn
As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services.   

You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:  

A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    1. You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
    2. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
    3. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., ‚ÄúConnections only‚Äù). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn‚Äù (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More
    4. While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. 
    5. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.  

You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).
By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone‚Äôs rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.
### 3.2 Service Availability
We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).
We don‚Äôt promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you‚Äôve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
### 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
Others‚Äô Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature.  

Others‚Äô Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using Services Marketplace or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.   

You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member‚Äôs offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products.   

For Services Marketplace, (a) you must be at least 18 years of age to procure, offer, or perform services, and (b) you represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with the relevant industry standards and our Professional Community Policies.   

Others‚Äô Events: Similarly, LinkedIn may help you register for and/or attend events organized by Members and connect with other Members who are attendees at such events. You agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for the conduct of any of the Members or other attendees at such events, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular event listed on our Services, (3) LinkedIn does not review and/or vet any of these events or speakers, and (4) you will adhere to the terms and conditions that apply to such events.
### 3.4 Limits
LinkedIn reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. LinkedIn reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if you breach this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services (e.g., violating any of the Dos and Don‚Äôts or Professional Community Policies).  

We can also remove any content or other information you shared if we believe it violates our Professional Community Policies or Dos and Don‚Äôts or otherwise violates this Contract. Learn more about how we moderate content.
### 3.5 Intellectual Property Rights
LinkedIn reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Services. Trademarks and logos used in connection with the Services are the trademarks of their respective owners. LinkedIn, and ‚Äúin‚Äù logos and other LinkedIn trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used for our Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of LinkedIn.
### 3.6 Recommendations and Automated Processing
Recommendations: We use the data and other information that you provide and that we have about Members and content on the Services to make recommendations for connections, content, ads, and features that may be useful to you. We use that data and other information to recommend and to present information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, that data and information may be used to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters and to organize content in your feed in order to optimize your experience and use of the Services. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant. Learn More
Generative AI Features: By using the Services, you may interact with features we offer that automate content generation for you. The content that is generated might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading or not suitable for your purposes. Please review and edit such content before sharing with others. Like all content you share on our Services, you are responsible for ensuring it complies with our Professional Community Policies, including not sharing misleading information.
The Services may include content automatically generated and shared using tools offered by LinkedIn or others off LinkedIn. Like all content and other information on our Services, regardless of whether it's labeled as created by ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, be sure to carefully review before relying on it.

LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT AND INFORMATION) ON AN ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù AND ‚ÄúAS AVAILABLE‚Äù BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
### 4.2 Exclusion of Liability
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS LINKEDIN HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), LINKEDIN, INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS OF DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT) OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

### 4.3 Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions
The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and LinkedIn and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if LinkedIn or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose.
THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY OR FOR FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, OR IN CASES OF NEGLIGENCE, WHERE A MATERIAL OBLIGATION HAS BEEN BREACHED. A MATERIAL OBLIGATION BEING AN OBLIGATION WHICH FORMS A PREREQUISITE TO OUR DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND ON WHICH YOU MAY REASONABLY RELY, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DAMAGES WERE DIRECTLY CAUSED BY THE BREACH AND WERE FORESEEABLE UPON CONCLUSION OF THIS CONTRACT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE TYPICAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONTRACT.
  5. ## 5. Termination
Both you and LinkedIn may terminate this Contract at any time with notice to the other. On termination, you lose the right to access or use the Services. The following shall survive termination:

     * Sections 4, 6, 7, and 8.2 of this Contract; and

You can visit our Help Center to learn about how to close your account
  6. ## 6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland.
If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (‚ÄúDMA‚Äù) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center.
For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
  7. ## 7. General Terms
If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.
You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.

  1. ## Introduction
### 1.1 Contract
By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (‚ÄúContract‚Äù or ‚ÄúUser Agreement‚Äù), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.  

#### Services
This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (‚ÄúServices‚Äù), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the ‚ÄúApply with LinkedIn‚Äù and ‚ÄúShare with LinkedIn‚Äù plugins.
#### LinkedIn
You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù).
We use the term ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
If you reside in the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (‚ÄúLinkedIn Ireland‚Äù) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
If you reside outside of the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (‚ÄúLinkedIn Corp.‚Äù) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in our Privacy Policy, and updates. You acknowledge and have read our Privacy Policy.
### 1.2 Members and Visitors  

When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a ‚ÄúMember‚Äù. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a ‚ÄúVisitor.‚Äù
### 1.3 Changes
  

  

We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
  2. ## 2. Obligations
### 2.1 Service Eligibility
The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
‚ÄúMinimum Age‚Äù means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More
### 2.2 Your Account
Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don‚Äôts (below), and our Professional Community Policies. Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.  

### 2.3 Payment
If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
     * Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).
     * We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more
     * If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services.
     * We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.
     * All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn‚Äôs refund policy.
     * We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.  

You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under ‚ÄúPurchase History‚Äù.  

### 2.4 Notices and Messages
You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.  

Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us.
### 2.5 Sharing
Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.  

To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.
  3. ## 3. Rights and Limits
### 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn
As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services.   

You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:  

A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    1. You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
    2. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
    3. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., ‚ÄúConnections only‚Äù). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn‚Äù (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More
    4. While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. 
    5. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.  

You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).
By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone‚Äôs rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.
### 3.2 Service Availability
We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).
We don‚Äôt promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you‚Äôve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
### 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
Others‚Äô Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature.  

Others‚Äô Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using Services Marketplace or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.   

You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member‚Äôs offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products.   

For Services Marketplace, (a) you must be at least 18 years of age to procure, offer, or perform services, and (b) you represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with the relevant industry standards and our Professional Community Policies.   

Others‚Äô Events: Similarly, LinkedIn may help you register for and/or attend events organized by Members and connect with other Members who are attendees at such events. You agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for the conduct of any of the Members or other attendees at such events, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular event listed on our Services, (3) LinkedIn does not review and/or vet any of these events or speakers, and (4) you will adhere to the terms and conditions that apply to such events.
### 3.4 Limits
LinkedIn reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. LinkedIn reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if you breach this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services (e.g., violating any of the Dos and Don‚Äôts or Professional Community Policies).  

We can also remove any content or other information you shared if we believe it violates our Professional Community Policies or Dos and Don‚Äôts or otherwise violates this Contract. Learn more about how we moderate content.
### 3.5 Intellectual Property Rights
LinkedIn reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Services. Trademarks and logos used in connection with the Services are the trademarks of their respective owners. LinkedIn, and ‚Äúin‚Äù logos and other LinkedIn trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used for our Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of LinkedIn.
### 3.6 Recommendations and Automated Processing
Recommendations: We use the data and other information that you provide and that we have about Members and content on the Services to make recommendations for connections, content, ads, and features that may be useful to you. We use that data and other information to recommend and to present information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, that data and information may be used to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters and to organize content in your feed in order to optimize your experience and use of the Services. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant. Learn More
Generative AI Features: By using the Services, you may interact with features we offer that automate content generation for you. The content that is generated might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading or not suitable for your purposes. Please review and edit such content before sharing with others. Like all content you share on our Services, you are responsible for ensuring it complies with our Professional Community Policies, including not sharing misleading information.
The Services may include content automatically generated and shared using tools offered by LinkedIn or others off LinkedIn. Like all content and other information on our Services, regardless of whether it's labeled as created by ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, be sure to carefully review before relying on it.

LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT AND INFORMATION) ON AN ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù AND ‚ÄúAS AVAILABLE‚Äù BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
### 4.2 Exclusion of Liability
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS LINKEDIN HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), LINKEDIN, INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS OF DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT) OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

### 4.3 Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions
The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and LinkedIn and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if LinkedIn or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose.
THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY OR FOR FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, OR IN CASES OF NEGLIGENCE, WHERE A MATERIAL OBLIGATION HAS BEEN BREACHED. A MATERIAL OBLIGATION BEING AN OBLIGATION WHICH FORMS A PREREQUISITE TO OUR DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND ON WHICH YOU MAY REASONABLY RELY, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DAMAGES WERE DIRECTLY CAUSED BY THE BREACH AND WERE FORESEEABLE UPON CONCLUSION OF THIS CONTRACT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE TYPICAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONTRACT.

You can visit our Help Center to learn about how to close your account
  6. ## 6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland.
If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (‚ÄúDMA‚Äù) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center.
For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
  7. ## 7. General Terms
If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.
You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.

  1. ## Introduction
### 1.1 Contract
By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (‚ÄúContract‚Äù or ‚ÄúUser Agreement‚Äù), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.  

#### Services
This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (‚ÄúServices‚Äù), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the ‚ÄúApply with LinkedIn‚Äù and ‚ÄúShare with LinkedIn‚Äù plugins.
#### LinkedIn
You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù).
We use the term ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
If you reside in the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (‚ÄúLinkedIn Ireland‚Äù) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
If you reside outside of the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (‚ÄúLinkedIn Corp.‚Äù) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in our Privacy Policy, and updates. You acknowledge and have read our Privacy Policy.
### 1.2 Members and Visitors  

When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a ‚ÄúMember‚Äù. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a ‚ÄúVisitor.‚Äù
### 1.3 Changes
  

  

We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
  2. ## 2. Obligations
### 2.1 Service Eligibility
The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
‚ÄúMinimum Age‚Äù means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More
### 2.2 Your Account
Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don‚Äôts (below), and our Professional Community Policies. Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.  

### 2.3 Payment
If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
     * Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).
     * We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more
     * If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services.
     * We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.
     * All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn‚Äôs refund policy.
     * We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.  

You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under ‚ÄúPurchase History‚Äù.  

### 2.4 Notices and Messages
You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.  

Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us.
### 2.5 Sharing
Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.  

To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.
  3. ## 3. Rights and Limits
### 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn
As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services.   

You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:  

A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    1. You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
    2. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
    3. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., ‚ÄúConnections only‚Äù). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn‚Äù (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More
    4. While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. 
    5. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.  

You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).
By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone‚Äôs rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.
### 3.2 Service Availability
We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).
We don‚Äôt promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you‚Äôve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
### 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
Others‚Äô Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature.  

Others‚Äô Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using Services Marketplace or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.   

You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member‚Äôs offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products.   

For Services Marketplace, (a) you must be at least 18 years of age to procure, offer, or perform services, and (b) you represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with the relevant industry standards and our Professional Community Policies.   

Others‚Äô Events: Similarly, LinkedIn may help you register for and/or attend events organized by Members and connect with other Members who are attendees at such events. You agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for the conduct of any of the Members or other attendees at such events, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular event listed on our Services, (3) LinkedIn does not review and/or vet any of these events or speakers, and (4) you will adhere to the terms and conditions that apply to such events.

We use that data and other information to recommend and to present information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, that data and information may be used to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters and to organize content in your feed in order to optimize your experience and use of the Services. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant. Learn More
Generative AI Features: By using the Services, you may interact with features we offer that automate content generation for you. The content that is generated might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading or not suitable for your purposes. Please review and edit such content before sharing with others. Like all content you share on our Services, you are responsible for ensuring it complies with our Professional Community Policies, including not sharing misleading information.
The Services may include content automatically generated and shared using tools offered by LinkedIn or others off LinkedIn. Like all content and other information on our Services, regardless of whether it's labeled as created by ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, be sure to carefully review before relying on it.

  6. ## 6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland.
If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (‚ÄúDMA‚Äù) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center.

You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
  7. ## 7. General Terms
If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.

  1. ## Introduction
### 1.1 Contract
By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (‚ÄúContract‚Äù or ‚ÄúUser Agreement‚Äù), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.  

#### Services
This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (‚ÄúServices‚Äù), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the ‚ÄúApply with LinkedIn‚Äù and ‚ÄúShare with LinkedIn‚Äù plugins.
#### LinkedIn
You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù).
We use the term ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
If you reside in the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (‚ÄúLinkedIn Ireland‚Äù) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
If you reside outside of the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (‚ÄúLinkedIn Corp.‚Äù) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in our Privacy Policy, and updates. You acknowledge and have read our Privacy Policy.
### 1.2 Members and Visitors  

When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a ‚ÄúMember‚Äù. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a ‚ÄúVisitor.‚Äù
### 1.3 Changes
  

  

We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
  2. ## 2. Obligations
### 2.1 Service Eligibility
The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
‚ÄúMinimum Age‚Äù means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More
### 2.2 Your Account
Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don‚Äôts (below), and our Professional Community Policies. Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.  

### 2.3 Payment
If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
     * Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).
     * We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more
     * If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services.
     * We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.
     * All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn‚Äôs refund policy.
     * We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.  

You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under ‚ÄúPurchase History‚Äù.  

### 2.4 Notices and Messages
You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.  

Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us.
### 2.5 Sharing
Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.  

To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.
  3. ## 3. Rights and Limits
### 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn
As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services.   

You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:  

A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    1. You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
    2. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
    3. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., ‚ÄúConnections only‚Äù). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn‚Äù (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More
    4. While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. 
    5. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.  

You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).
By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone‚Äôs rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.
### 3.2 Service Availability
We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).
We don‚Äôt promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you‚Äôve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
### 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
Others‚Äô Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature.

  6. ## 6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland.
If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (‚ÄúDMA‚Äù) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center.

You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
  7. ## 7. General Terms
If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.

  1. ## Introduction
### 1.1 Contract
By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (‚ÄúContract‚Äù or ‚ÄúUser Agreement‚Äù), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.  

#### Services
This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (‚ÄúServices‚Äù), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the ‚ÄúApply with LinkedIn‚Äù and ‚ÄúShare with LinkedIn‚Äù plugins.
#### LinkedIn
You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù).
We use the term ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
If you reside in the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (‚ÄúLinkedIn Ireland‚Äù) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
If you reside outside of the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (‚ÄúLinkedIn Corp.‚Äù) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in our Privacy Policy, and updates. You acknowledge and have read our Privacy Policy.
### 1.2 Members and Visitors  

When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a ‚ÄúMember‚Äù. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a ‚ÄúVisitor.‚Äù
### 1.3 Changes
  

  

We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
  2. ## 2. Obligations
### 2.1 Service Eligibility
The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
‚ÄúMinimum Age‚Äù means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More
### 2.2 Your Account
Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don‚Äôts (below), and our Professional Community Policies. Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.  

### 2.3 Payment
If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
     * Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).
     * We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more
     * If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services.
     * We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.
     * All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn‚Äôs refund policy.
     * We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.  

You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under ‚ÄúPurchase History‚Äù.  

### 2.4 Notices and Messages
You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.  

Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us.
### 2.5 Sharing
Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.  

To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.
  3. ## 3. Rights and Limits
### 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn
As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services.   

You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:  

A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    1. You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
    2. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
    3. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., ‚ÄúConnections only‚Äù). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn‚Äù (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More
    4. While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. 
    5. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.  

You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).
By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone‚Äôs rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.
### 3.2 Service Availability
We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).
We don‚Äôt promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you‚Äôve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
### 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
Others‚Äô Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature.  

Others‚Äô Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using Services Marketplace or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.

  6. ## 6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland.
If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (‚ÄúDMA‚Äù) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center.

You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
  7. ## 7. General Terms
If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.

  1. ## Introduction
### 1.1 Contract
By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (‚ÄúContract‚Äù or ‚ÄúUser Agreement‚Äù), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.  

#### Services
This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (‚ÄúServices‚Äù), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the ‚ÄúApply with LinkedIn‚Äù and ‚ÄúShare with LinkedIn‚Äù plugins.
#### LinkedIn
You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù).
We use the term ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
If you reside in the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (‚ÄúLinkedIn Ireland‚Äù) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
If you reside outside of the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (‚ÄúLinkedIn Corp.‚Äù) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in our Privacy Policy, and updates. You acknowledge and have read our Privacy Policy.
### 1.2 Members and Visitors  

When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a ‚ÄúMember‚Äù. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a ‚ÄúVisitor.‚Äù
### 1.3 Changes
  

  

We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
  2. ## 2. Obligations
### 2.1 Service Eligibility
The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
‚ÄúMinimum Age‚Äù means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More
### 2.2 Your Account
Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don‚Äôts (below), and our Professional Community Policies. Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.  

### 2.3 Payment
If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
     * Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).
     * We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more
     * If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services.
     * We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.
     * All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn‚Äôs refund policy.
     * We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.  

You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under ‚ÄúPurchase History‚Äù.  

### 2.4 Notices and Messages
You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.  

Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us.
### 2.5 Sharing
Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.  

To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.
  3. ## 3. Rights and Limits
### 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn
As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services.   

You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:  

A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    1. You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
    2. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
    3. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., ‚ÄúConnections only‚Äù). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn‚Äù (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More
    4. While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. 
    5. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.  

You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).
By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone‚Äôs rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.
### 3.2 Service Availability
We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).
We don‚Äôt promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you‚Äôve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
### 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
Others‚Äô Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature.  

Others‚Äô Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using Services Marketplace or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.   

You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member‚Äôs offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products.

  6. ## 6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland.
If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (‚ÄúDMA‚Äù) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center.

  7. ## 7. General Terms
If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.

Managing a team with diverse communication styles requires empathy, clarity, and adaptability. Start by recognizing and respecting each member‚Äôs preferred communication approach‚Äîsome may value directness, while others prefer detailed context. Establish clear guidelines for communication channels and expectations. Encourage open dialogue and active listening to bridge gaps. Use a mix of written, verbal, and visual tools to ensure everyone stays informed. Foster an inclusive environment where feedback is welcomed and differences are appreciated. By promoting mutual understanding and flexibility, you create a collaborative space where everyone can contribute effectively.

The key is building a shared communication culture without erasing individual styles. I start by listening‚Äîunderstanding how each teammate prefers to give and receive information. Then we co-create lightweight team norms: when to use Slack vs. email, expectations for response times, and how we make decisions transparent. I‚Äôve found that giving space for both async thinkers and real-time talkers leads to better ideas and fewer misunderstandings. Flexibility + clarity = collaboration that actually works.

The first step is to set clear communication norms‚Äîdefine how and where the team communicates, expected response times, and meeting practices. This creates a level playing field and reduces friction. Next, use multiple formats to deliver your message. Some team members may prefer concise written updates, while others thrive on face-to-face discussions or visual cues. By varying your approach‚Äîemails, Slack updates, video calls, or visual briefs‚Äîyou make space for everyone to engage meaningfully. Finally, lead by example. Be flexible in your communication style, and show that you value clarity and connection over conformity. When the team sees you adapting, they‚Äôre more likely to do the same.

While managing a cross-functional team on a global project, I noticed miscommunication was slowing us down. Some preferred quick chats, others detailed emails. I introduced a team charter where everyone listed their preferred communication style. We agreed on hybrid updates: key points via email, deeper discussions in meetings. I also ran a short session on active listening. Within weeks, collaboration improved, misunderstandings reduced, and project milestones were met on time.

In my experience, the real breakthrough happens when you stop expecting everyone to fit in and start creating space for them to show up as they are. One thing that‚Äôs helped me: having honest one-on-one conversations to understand each team member‚Äôs comfort zone, some prefer emails, and a few just want a discussion. Once you tune into that, collaboration becomes a lot more natural. Also, just being mindful during team discussions pausing to ask the quieter ones for their thoughts or following up after meetings goes a long way in making people feel seen. At the end of the day, communication isn‚Äôt just about clarity, it‚Äôs about connection.

  1. ## Introduction
### 1.1 Contract
By creating a LinkedIn account or accessing or using our Services (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using third party credentials or using our Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (‚ÄúContract‚Äù or ‚ÄúUser Agreement‚Äù), do not create an account or access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this Contract at any time, you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.  

#### Services
This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps, communications, and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (‚ÄúServices‚Äù), including the offsite collection of data for those Services, such as via our ads and the ‚ÄúApply with LinkedIn‚Äù and ‚ÄúShare with LinkedIn‚Äù plugins.
#### LinkedIn
You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as ‚Äúwe‚Äù and ‚Äúus‚Äù).
We use the term ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.
If you reside in the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (‚ÄúLinkedIn Ireland‚Äù) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
If you reside outside of the ‚ÄúDesignated Countries‚Äù, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (‚ÄúLinkedIn Corp.‚Äù) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of (or business responsible for) your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.
As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use, and sharing of your personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy, our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in our Privacy Policy, and updates. You acknowledge and have read our Privacy Policy.
### 1.2 Members and Visitors  

When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a ‚ÄúMember‚Äù. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a ‚ÄúVisitor.‚Äù
### 1.3 Changes
  

  

We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy from time to time. If required by applicable law or we make material changes to this Contract, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any of these changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
  2. ## 2. Obligations
### 2.1 Service Eligibility
The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.
To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the "Minimum Age" (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.
‚ÄúMinimum Age‚Äù means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Learn More
### 2.2 Your Account
Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) protect against wrongful access to your account (e.g., use a strong password and keep it confidential); (2) not share or transfer your account or any part of it (e.g., sell or transfer the personal data of others by transferring your connections); and (3) follow the law, our list of Dos and Don‚Äôts (below), and our Professional Community Policies. Learn More You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.
As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g., Recruiter seat or LinkedIn Learning subscription bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.  

### 2.3 Payment
If you buy any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and you agree to the additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:
     * Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g., exchange rates).
     * We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g., credit card), even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your paid Services and to use it to pay for other Services you may buy. You may update or change your payment method. Learn more
     * If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how to cancel or suspend your paid subscription Services.
     * We may modify our prices effective prospectively upon reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.
     * All of your paid Services are subject to LinkedIn‚Äôs refund policy.
     * We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us.  

You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under ‚ÄúPurchase History‚Äù.  

### 2.4 Notices and Messages
You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Services or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.  

Please review your settings to control and limit messages you receive from us.
### 2.5 Sharing
Our Services allow sharing of information (including content) in many ways, such as through your profile, posts, articles, group posts, links to news articles, job postings, messages, and InMails. Depending on the feature and choices you make, information that you share may be seen by other Members, Visitors, or others (on or off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or other information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn connections, restricting your profile visibility from search tools, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections or the public. So, if you apply for a job through our Services or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job poster.  

To the extent that laws allow this, we are not obligated to publish any content or other information on our Services and can remove it with or without notice.
  3. ## 3. Rights and Limits
### 3.1. Your License to LinkedIn
As between you and LinkedIn, you own your original content that you submit or post to the Services.   

You grant LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license to the content and other information you provide (e.g., share, post, upload, and/or otherwise submit) to our Services:  

A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly perform and display, host, and process your content and other information without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:
    1. You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your account, except (a) to the extent you (1) shared it with others as part of the Services and they copied, re-shared it or stored it, (2) we had already sublicensed others prior to your content removal or closing of your account, or (3) we are required by law to retain or share it with others, and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.
    2. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored content). However, without compensation to you or others, ads may be served near your content and other information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within our Services, subject to your settings.
    3. We will honor the audience choices for shared content (e.g., ‚ÄúConnections only‚Äù). For example, if you choose to share your post to "Anyone on or off LinkedIn‚Äù (or similar): (a) we may make it available off LinkedIn; (b) we may enable others to publicly share onto third-party services (e.g., a Member embedding your post on a third party service); and/or (c) we may enable search tools to make that public content findable though their services. Learn More
    4. While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size, layout or file type, and removing or adding labels or metadata), we will take steps to avoid materially modifying the meaning of your expression in content you share with others. 
    5. Because you own your original content and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license.  

You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process, and use any information (including content and/or personal data) that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including settings).
By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.
You agree to only provide content and other information that does not violate the law or anyone‚Äôs rights (including intellectual property rights). You have choices about how much information to provide on your profile but also agree that the profile information you provide will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove certain content and other information in certain countries.
### 3.2 Service Availability
We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also limit the availability of features, content and other information so that they are not available to all Visitors or Members (e.g., by country or by subscription access).
We don‚Äôt promise to store or show (or keep showing) any information (including content) that you‚Äôve shared. LinkedIn is not a storage service. You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or other information that you or others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.
### 3.3 Other Content, Sites and Apps
Others‚Äô Content: By using the Services, you may encounter content or other information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading, illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful. You agree that we are not responsible for content or other information made available through or within the Services by others, including Members. While we apply automated tools to review much of the content and other information presented in the Services, we cannot always prevent misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse. You also acknowledge the risk that others may share inaccurate or misleading information about you or your organization, and that you or your organization may be mistakenly associated with content about others, for example, when we let connections and followers know you or your organization were mentioned in the news. Members have choices about this feature.  

Others‚Äô Products and Services: LinkedIn may help connect you to other Members (e.g., Members using Services Marketplace or our enterprise recruiting, jobs, sales, or marketing products) who offer you opportunities (on behalf of themselves, their organizations, or others) such as offers to become a candidate for employment or other work or offers to purchase products or services. You acknowledge that LinkedIn does not perform these offered services, employ those who perform these services, or provide these offered products.   

You further acknowledge that LinkedIn does not supervise, direct, control, or monitor Members in the making of these offers, or in their providing you with work, delivering products or performing services, and you agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for these offers, or performance or procurement of them, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular Member‚Äôs offers, and (3) LinkedIn is not an agent or employment agency on behalf of any Member offering employment or other work, products or services. With respect to employment or other work, LinkedIn does not make employment or hiring decisions on behalf of Members offering opportunities and does not have such authority from Members or organizations using our products.   

For Services Marketplace, (a) you must be at least 18 years of age to procure, offer, or perform services, and (b) you represent and warrant that you have all the required licenses and will provide services consistent with the relevant industry standards and our Professional Community Policies.   

Others‚Äô Events: Similarly, LinkedIn may help you register for and/or attend events organized by Members and connect with other Members who are attendees at such events. You agree that (1) LinkedIn is not responsible for the conduct of any of the Members or other attendees at such events, (2) LinkedIn does not endorse any particular event listed on our Services, (3) LinkedIn does not review and/or vet any of these events or speakers, and (4) you will adhere to the terms and conditions that apply to such events.
### 3.4 Limits
LinkedIn reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including the number of your connections and your ability to contact other Members. LinkedIn reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate your account if you breach this Contract or the law or are misusing the Services (e.g., violating any of the Dos and Don‚Äôts or Professional Community Policies).  

We can also remove any content or other information you shared if we believe it violates our Professional Community Policies or Dos and Don‚Äôts or otherwise violates this Contract. Learn more about how we moderate content.
### 3.5 Intellectual Property Rights
LinkedIn reserves all of its intellectual property rights in the Services. Trademarks and logos used in connection with the Services are the trademarks of their respective owners. LinkedIn, and ‚Äúin‚Äù logos and other LinkedIn trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used for our Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of LinkedIn.
### 3.6 Recommendations and Automated Processing
Recommendations: We use the data and other information that you provide and that we have about Members and content on the Services to make recommendations for connections, content, ads, and features that may be useful to you. We use that data and other information to recommend and to present information to you in an order that may be more relevant for you. For example, that data and information may be used to recommend jobs to you and you to recruiters and to organize content in your feed in order to optimize your experience and use of the Services. Keeping your profile accurate and up to date helps us to make these recommendations more accurate and relevant. Learn More
Generative AI Features: By using the Services, you may interact with features we offer that automate content generation for you. The content that is generated might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading or not suitable for your purposes. Please review and edit such content before sharing with others. Like all content you share on our Services, you are responsible for ensuring it complies with our Professional Community Policies, including not sharing misleading information.
The Services may include content automatically generated and shared using tools offered by LinkedIn or others off LinkedIn. Like all content and other information on our Services, regardless of whether it's labeled as created by ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, be sure to carefully review before relying on it.

LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT AND INFORMATION) ON AN ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù AND ‚ÄúAS AVAILABLE‚Äù BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, LINKEDIN AND ITS AFFILIATES DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, ACCURACY OF DATA, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
### 4.2 Exclusion of Liability
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND UNLESS LINKEDIN HAS ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT THAT OVERRIDES THIS CONTRACT), LINKEDIN, INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT FOR LOST PROFITS OR LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, REPUTATION (E.G., OFFENSIVE OR DEFAMATORY STATEMENTS), LOSS OF DATA (E.G., DOWN TIME OR LOSS, USE OF, OR CHANGES TO, YOUR INFORMATION OR CONTENT) OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

### 4.3 Basis of the Bargain; Exclusions
The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and LinkedIn and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if LinkedIn or its affiliates has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose.
THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY DO NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY OR FOR FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, OR IN CASES OF NEGLIGENCE, WHERE A MATERIAL OBLIGATION HAS BEEN BREACHED. A MATERIAL OBLIGATION BEING AN OBLIGATION WHICH FORMS A PREREQUISITE TO OUR DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND ON WHICH YOU MAY REASONABLY RELY, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DAMAGES WERE DIRECTLY CAUSED BY THE BREACH AND WERE FORESEEABLE UPON CONCLUSION OF THIS CONTRACT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE TYPICAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CONTRACT.

Both you and LinkedIn may terminate this Contract at any time with notice to the other. On termination, you lose the right to access or use the Services. The following shall survive termination:
     * Our rights to use and disclose your feedback;

     * Sections 4, 6, 7, and 8.2 of this Contract; and
     * Any amounts owed by either party prior to termination remain owed after termination.
You can visit our Help Center to learn about how to close your account
  6. ## 6. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
If you live in the Designated Countries, the laws of Ireland govern all claims related to LinkedIn's provision of the Services, but this shall not deprive you of the mandatory consumer protections under the law of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence. With respect to jurisdiction, you and LinkedIn agree to choose the courts of the country to which we direct your Services where you have habitual residence for all disputes arising out of or relating to this User Agreement, or in the alternative, you may choose the responsible court in Ireland.
If you are a business user within the scope of Article 6(12) of the EU Digital Markets Act (‚ÄúDMA‚Äù) and have a dispute arising out of or in connection with Article 6(12) of the DMA, you may also utilize the alternative dispute resolution mechanism available in the Help Center.
For others outside of Designated Countries, including those who live outside of the United States: You and LinkedIn agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, shall exclusively govern any dispute relating to this Contract and/or the Services. You and LinkedIn both agree that all claims and disputes can be litigated only in the federal or state courts in Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and LinkedIn each agree to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
  7. ## 7. General Terms
If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.
This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.
If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that LinkedIn has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent. However, you agree that LinkedIn may assign this Contract to its affiliates or a party that buys it without your consent. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Contract.
You agree that the only way to provide us legal notice is at the addresses provided in Section 10.

We ask that you report content and other information that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights), our Professional Community Policies or otherwise violates this Contract or the law. To the extent we can under law, we may remove or restrict access to content, features, services, or information, including if we believe that it‚Äôs reasonably necessary to avoid harm to LinkedIn or others, violates the law or is reasonably necessary to prevent misuse of our Services. We reserve the right to take action against serious violations of this Contract, including by implementing account restrictions for significant violations.  

We respect the intellectual property rights of others. We require that information shared by Members be accurate and not in violation of the intellectual property rights or other rights of third parties.

##  Help employees build relevant skills with online courses 
With in-demand skill requirements quickly changing, an on-demand online learning platform is essential for upskilling. New hires rarely arrive with all the skills needed to perform a job. Even if they do, those skills change over time.  
  
LinkedIn Learning leverages skills data from LinkedIn, the world‚Äôs largest professional social media network, to inform the online education courses we develop to help your agency stay ahead of the curve.  

According to the World Economic Forum, one-third of core job skills will change in the next 5 years.
