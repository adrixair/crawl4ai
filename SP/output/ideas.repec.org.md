## Abstract
O processo de produção de edifícios de escritórios de alto padrão na cidade de São Paulo também se beneficiou da abundância de recursos disponíveis para investimento no mercado imobiliário desde 2007. Quanto mais o crescimento da economia induzia à ocupação rápida dos espaços disponíveis, mais atraente ficavam os investimentos no setor, até que a brusca queda da atividade econômica e o aumento significativo da oferta impactou na queda da velocidade de ocupação e no aumento da vacância. Todavia, como os impactos são diferentes nas diferentes regiões da cidade, apesar da grande oferta em relação à demanda de novos espaços na cidade como um todo, pode ser razoável considerar que algumas regiões de maior interesse dos ocupantes apresentarão menor vacância, enquanto outras regiões, de menor interesse dos ocupantes, apresentarão maior vacância para o mesmo padrão de produto. Tal diferença de “liquidez” seria resultado dos atributos da localização, seja pela melhor infra-estrutura disponível nas regiões mais consolidadas, seja pela menor disponibilidade de terrenos aptos para desenvolvimento, limitando a oferta, exatamente pelo fato dessas regiões serem consolidadas.

## Credits
IDEAS is run with considerable help from others by Christian Zimmermann. IDEAS uses the RePEc database. RePEc  stands for "Research Papers in Economics" and is an internal name for a group working on the provision of electronic working papers. We are concerned that the uncoordinated provision of archives is inefficient. We believe that joining forces is a good thing because we can learn from each other how to do things better and promote our work together. Our archives are interconnected using a set of rules called the Guildford protocol (GuilP). Here is what we call a service, a server mirroring the database built from these archives. 
Comments about IDEAS should be addressed to Christian Zimmermann. To get new serials listed, see these instructions. To request corrections, please look first at these instructions. The usual copyright laws apply to all the content of this site and the texts on other servers.

### Tips:
  * For phrase searches, put words between double quotes (" "). 
  * For boolean searches, use + for AND, | for OR and ~ for NOT. Group with parentheses. Example: _(money | currency) ~liquidity_
  * Search for _AuthorOne AuthorTwo (Year)_ to get a link to that work. 
  * Search automatically uses synonyms ( for example, labor=labour, US=United States) and algorithmic word stemming (find, finds, finding, etc). 
  * You may also want to browse through material classified through Journal of Economic Literature codes. A search limited to a JEL code is available on those pages. 
  * Similarly, search from within a series or journal page to restrict results to that serial. 
  * With this form, you search the bibliographic records, not the texts themselves. IDEAS does not host any full text. 
  * You can also have a look at this tutorial.
